	abstract = {Context: Trends in contraceptive use have implications for shifts in pregnancy rates and birthrates and can inform clinical practice of changes in needs for contraceptive methods and services. Methods: Information on current contraceptive use was collected from a representative sample of women of reproductive age in the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). This information is compared with similar data from 1982 and 1988 to examine trends in use, both overall and in social and demographic subgroups. Results: The proportion of U.S. women using a contraceptive method rose from 56\% in 1982 to 60\% in 1988 and 64\% in 1995. As in 1982 and 1988, female sterilization, the pill and the male condom were the most widely used methods in 1995. Between 1988 and 1995, the proportion of users relying on the pill decreased from 31\% to 27\%, while condom use rose from 15\% to 20\%. The largest decreases in pill use and the largest increases in condom use occurred among never-married women and among black women younger than 25. Reliance on the IUD dropped sharply among Hispanic women, while use of the diaphragm fell among college-educated white women. Conclusions: The decline in pill and diaphragm use and the increase in reliance on condoms suggest that concerns about HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases are changing patterns of method use among unmarried women.},

Where data were available, patterns of condom use during sexual intercourse from the 2011–2015 NSFG were compared with the 2002 and 2006–2010 NSFG. Methods—Data were collected through in-person interviews with nationally representative, independent samples of women and men aged 15–44 in the household population of the United States. Interviews were conducted between September 2011 and September 2015 with 11,300 women and 9,321 men. The response rates for the 2011–2015 NSFG were 72.3\% for women and 69.6\% for men aged 15–44. Results—During 2011–2015, 23.8\% of women and 33.7\% of men aged 15–44 used a condom at last sexual intercourse in the past 12 months, an increase for men since 2002 (29.5\%). Among condom users, 59.9\% of women and 56.4\% of men aged 15–44 used only a condom and no other method during last intercourse in the past 12 months; another 25.0\% of women and 33.2\% of men used condoms plus hormonal methods; and 15.1\% of women and 10.5\% of men used condoms plus nonhormonal methods. During any intercourse in the past 4 weeks, 18.2\% of women and 23.9\% of men aged 15–44 used a condom “100\%” of the time. The prevalence of condom use during any intercourse in the past 4 weeks varied by age, education, Hispanic origin and race, relationship at last sexual intercourse, and number of opposite-sex sexual partners in the past 12 months. Almost 7\% of women aged 15–44 who used a condom in the past 4 weeks said the condom broke or completely fell off during intercourse or withdrawal, and 25.8\% said the condom was used for only part of the time during intercourse.},

	abstract = {Objective—This report presents national estimates of the proportion of sexually experienced women aged 15–44 who have ever used various methods of contraception in the United States. Trends are shown since 1982, and results are shown by Hispanic origin and race, education, and religious affiliation. The number of methods ever used is also shown, along with reasons for stopping use of selected methods. Methods—Data for 2006–2010 were collected through in-person interviews with 22,682 women and men aged 15–44 in the household population of the United States. Interviews were conducted by female interviewers in the homes of sampled persons. This report is based primarily on the sample of 12,279 women interviewed in 2006–2010 from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). Data from earlier NSFGs are presented to show trends in method choice since 1982. Results—Virtually all women of reproductive age in 2006–2010 who had ever had sexual intercourse have used at least one contraceptive method at some point in their lifetime (99\%, or 53 million women aged 15–44), including 88\% who have used a highly effective, reversible method such as birth control pills, an injectable method, a contraceptive patch, or an intrauterine device. In 2006–2010, the most common methods that women or their partners had ever used were: the male condom (93\%), the pill (82\%), withdrawal (60\%), and the injectable, Depo-Provera (23\%). Method use varied by race and Hispanic origin, nativity among Hispanics, education, and religious affiliation, with significant proportions of women in all categories having used one or more of the most effective methods. The median number of methods ever used by women was about three, but nearly 30\% have used five or more methods. Side effects were the most common reason for discontinuing use of the pill, Depo-Provera, and the patch among women who had ever discontinued using these methods due to dissatisfaction.},

	abstract = {Abstract Problem: Contraceptive use is an important determinant of unintended pregnancy. In the United States, approximately half of all pregnancies are unintended. Population-based information about contraceptive use patterns is limited at the state level. Information about contraceptive use for states can be used to guide the development of state programs and policies to decrease unintended pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted infections. Information about contraceptive use for specific subpopulations can be used to further refine state efforts to improve contraceptive use and subsequently decrease the occurrence of unintended pregnancy. Reporting Period: Data were collected in 2002 for men and women. Description of System: The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a random-digit–dialed, telephone survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population aged ≥18 years. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands participated in BRFSS in 2002. These data can be used to track state progress towards the national health objectives for 2010 for responsible sexual behavior. The 2002 BRFSS data represent the first time state data on contraceptive use in all 50 states will be presented and examined by selected sociodemographic characteristics. The 2002 BRFSS also, for the first time, provided an opportunity to examine state-level contraceptive use patterns among men. Results: Variation across states and territories was observed for the majority of contraceptive methods among the different demographics analyzed and among men and women. The percentage of men and women at risk for pregnancy who said they or their partner was using birth control was high overall and ranged from 67\% (Guam) to 88\% (Idaho). Oral contraceptives (i.e., the pill), vasectomy, tubal ligation, and condoms were the methods most frequently reported by both male and female respondents who said they or their partner was using birth control. Among female respondents using birth control, the pill was the most common method reported. Among men, vasectomy was the most commonly reported method. The prevalence of use for the four most commonly reported methods (pills, vasectomy, tubal ligation, condoms) varied as much as six-fold among states for vasectomy and three- to four-fold for condoms, pills, and tubal ligation. Interpretation: The findings in this report document substantial differences among states and sociodemographic groups within states in contraceptive method use. Public Health Action: These data can help states identify populations with an unmet need for birth control, barriers to birth control use, and gaps in the range of birth control methods offered by health-care providers. An analysis of the prevalence of birth control use by state and selected population characteristics can help states target contraceptive programs to best meet the needs of their population.},

	abstract = {Objective
The objective was to examine levels of, correlates of and changes in the use of individual and grouped methods of contraception among US females aged 15–44 from 2008 to 2014.
Study design
Using three rounds of the National Survey of Family Growth, we analyzed samples of 12,279 (2008), 5601 (2012) and 5699 (2014) females. We conducted simple and multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify associations between demographic characteristics and contraceptive use, as well as between characteristics and changes in use patterns.
Results
In terms of overall trends in contraceptive use between 2008 and 2014, there was no significant change in the proportion of women who used a method among either all women (60\%) or those at risk of unintended pregnancy (90\%). Significant changes in use occurred among six methods. The largest increase in use was among users of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods, including the intrauterine device and implant — from 6\% to 14\% — across almost all population groups of female contraceptive users, while the largest decrease occurred among users of sterilization — from 37\% to 28\% — with lower-income women driving the decline in female sterilization and higher-income women driving the decline in a partner's sterilization as a primary method. Moderate increases were seen in the use of withdrawal and natural family planning.
Conclusion
Most shifts in recent contraceptive use have occurred among the most effective methods — sterilization and LARCs. Differences in method-specific user characteristics underscore the importance of ensuring full access to the broad range of methods available.
Implications
The lack of change in the overall use of contraceptives among women at risk for unintended pregnancy may have implications for the extent to which further declines in national rates of unintended pregnancy can be expected.},
