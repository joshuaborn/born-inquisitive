# Own Estimates of Contraceptive Use or Nonuse

```



# `CONSTAT`

## Levels

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
as.data.table(levels(fem_2017_2019_data$CONSTAT1))[
  , .(
    ID = .I,
    level = V1
  )
] |> kable()
```

## Estimates

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~CONSTAT1,
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal,
  ordered = FALSE
) |> in_millions() |> kable()
```

## Using Contraception

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~I(as.integer(CONSTAT1) %in% 1:22),
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal,
  ordered = FALSE
) |> in_millions() |> kable()
```

## Not Sexually Active

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~I(as.integer(CONSTAT1) %in% 31:32),
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal,
  ordered = FALSE
)[level == TRUE] |> in_millions() |> kable()
```


# Discrepancies

## Not Sexually Active

There is a big discrepancy between the number of sexually inactive females reported here (21.361) and what is estimated by `CONSTAT1` (12.236) million.

Here only females who have had sexual intercourse in the previous 3 months are counted as using contraception. By `CONSTAT1` logic, any females who have had contraceptive sterilizing operations are assigned a `CONSTAT1` value of `01` "Female sterilization."

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~I(
    SEX3MO != 'YES' &
    FECUND == 1 &
    STRLOPER %in% 1:2
  ),
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal
) |> in_millions() |> kable()
```

This accounts for 2 million females of the difference in the estimates.

Likewise, all pregnant females are given a `CONSTAT1` of `30`, regardless of whether they are sexually active.


```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~I(
    SEX3MO != 'YES' &
    RCURPREG == 'YES (CURRENTLY PREGNANT)'
  ),
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal
) |> in_millions() |> kable()
```

This only accounts for about 0.195 million females of the difference in the estimates.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~I(
    SEX3MO != 'YES' &
    !is.element(CONSTAT1, 40:41)
  ),
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal
) |> in_millions() |> kable()
```

More generally, though, all of the females who have not had sexual intercourse in the previous 3 months, but who are given a `CONSTAT1` value not `40` or `41` amount to about 9.208 million females. The difference in the estimates is $21.361 - 12.236$ or $9.125$ million females. Thus, this accounts for the difference in the estimates.


## Pill

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~I(
    SEX3MO != 'YES' &
    using1m_meth3
  ),
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal
) |> in_millions() |> kable()
```

The estimated 2.899 million females who report using pills in the current month, but who are not sexually active within the past 3 months, more than account for the difference between estimates of $10.139 - 7.847 = 2.292$. The excess is likely due to there being several methods above pill in the `CONSTAT` prioritization.


## Hormonal Implant

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~I(
    SEX3MO != 'YES' &
    using1m_meth9
  ),
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal
) |> in_millions() |> kable()
```

Likewise, users of hormonal plants who have not had sexual intercourse with a male in the past 3 months explains the difference in the corresponding estimates $1.459 - 1.161 = 0.298$.


## Hormonal Injectable

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~I(
    SEX3MO != 'YES' &
    using1m_meth8
  ),
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal
) |> in_millions() |> kable()
```

Similarly, difference in estimates for hormonal injectable use $1.423 - 1.041 = 0.382$ is explained by same-month users who have not had intercourse in 3 months.

## Sterile, nonsurgical, female

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~I(
    SEX3MO != 'YES' &
    FECUND == 3 &
    POSIBLPG == 'No'
  ),
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal
) |> in_millions() |> kable()
```

There is a large difference in the number of nonsurgically sterile females between own estimates and `CONSTAT1` of $1.861 - 0.369 = 1.492$ million. Only about $0.883$ million is accounted for by the number of nonsurgically sterile females who have not had sexual intercourse with a male in the past 3 months.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~I(
    meth3m_count > 0 &
    FECUND == 3 &
    POSIBLPG == 'No'
  ),
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal
) |> in_millions() |> kable()
```

Another $0.472$ million females are nonsurgically sterile, but used a contraceptive method at last intercourse with a male within 3 months.

This raises the question, should those who report being sterile be included in the counts for contraceptive use, as was done here up until now? Or should those who are reportedly sterile not be included in the counts of contraceptive use?

My thinking on this goes back and forth. On the one hand, there may be people who are infertile, but are using contraceptive methods for noncontraceptive reasons, such as menstrual regulation. On the other hand, there may be people in falsely think they are infertile and who are using contraceptive methods. This is something to handle after investigating these other questions and coming up with estimates of what is more common: noncontraceptive contraception use among infertile females or unsound belief that a someone is infertile.


## Pregnant

A similar question can be asked about those who are pregnant, but using a contraceptive method. 

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~I(
    meth3m_count > 0 &
    RCURPREG == 'YES (CURRENTLY PREGNANT)'
  ),
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal
) |> in_millions() |> kable()
```

There aren't many who fall into this category, but it is nonzero.

There raises yet another issue. The analysis thus far assumes that any females who are currently pregnant were also pregnant during their last sexual intercourse with a male within the past 3 months. This is not necessarily the case. Indeed, it might have been that intercourse that caused a respondent to become pregnant.

Ideally, instead of using `RCURPREG`, which denotes whether a respondent is currently pregnant, the analysis should use whether the respondent was pregnant at last intercourse with a male.

Unfortunately, the month when a pregnancy begins is not included in the NSFG public use data files. Only the years of pregnancy beginnings and endings  and the age of the female at pregnancy beginnings and endings are included.

There is, however, the `LSEXPREG` computed variable.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  SEX3MO == 'YES',
  table(LSEXPREG, RCURPREG)
]

svytable(
  ~LSEXPREG + RCURPREG,
  subset(fem_2017_2019_svy, SEX3MO == 'YES')
) / 10^6
```

There are relatively few females who report not being pregnant at last sexual intercourse with a male and now being currently pregnant, but more who report not being currently pregnant while being pregnant _in month_ of last sexual intercourse. Being pregnant in the month of last sexual intercourse is slightly closer to the question of whether someone was pregnant _during_ last sexual intercourse, but still not exactly the desired information. This would technically still include those who became pregnant because of last sexual intercourse.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svyci(
  ~I(
    meth3m_count > 0 &
    LSEXPREG == 'YES'
  ),
  fem_2017_2019_svy,
  svytotal
) |> in_millions() |> kable()
```

More females were using contraception at last intercourse and pregnant in the month of last intercourse than were using contraception at last intercourse and currently pregnant.

For lack of anything better, the analysis will use `LSEXPREG` instead of `RCURPREG`, and count those who were using a contraceptive method at last intercourse as contraceptive users. "Pregnant" will only count those who were pregnant in month of last intercourse and did not use a method of contraception.


## Nonusers

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
svytable(
  ~I(CURRMETH1 == 1)+I(meth3m_count==0),
  subset(fem_2017_2019_svy, SEX3MO == 'YES')
) / 10^6
```

Approximately $3.186$ million females report no contraceptive method used in the month of the interview, but used at least one contraceptive method at last intercourse within the past 3 months. Furthermore, approximately $1.080$ million females report not using any contraceptive method at last intercourse, but using some kind of contraceptive method during month of the interview (or possibily did not reply, didn't know, or were sterile). This accounts for the differences in the estimates of nonusers.


# Estimation of Postpartum Females

This is calculated for `CONSTAT1` by comparing `CMINTVW` with `CMLSTPRG`. However, `CMLSTPRG` in the public use files does not contain month information, and the public use files do not contain the day of the interview, so this cannot be calculated from the public use files. Because of this, try to estimate postpartum females using `CONSTAT1`.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
collect_estimate(
  svyci(
    ~curr_use2,
    fem_2017_2019_svy,
    svytotal
  ),
  type = 'total',
  domain = 'females aged 15-49 living in households in the United States',
  title = 'by current contraceptive status, including postpartum',
)[, .(level, estimate, se, `2.5 %`, `97.5 %`)] |> kable()
```

The estimate of postpartum females has a statistically significant difference from zero and does decrease the estimate of those otherwise not using contraception, so it should be included in the estimates, at least for females.

Unfortunately, there is not an equivalent recode for males in the public use data files, so males whose last intercourse was with a postpartum partner cannot be estimated.
