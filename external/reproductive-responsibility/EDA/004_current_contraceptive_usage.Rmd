### Not Currently Using Contraception


#### Not Currently Sexually Active

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
kable(tablena(fem_2017_2019_data$MTHUSE3))

kable(tablena(fem_2017_2019_data$SEX3MO))

kable(tablena(fem_2017_2019_data$HADSEX))

fem_2017_2019_data[MTHUSE3 == 'No answer provided', .N] ==
  fem_2017_2019_data[SEX3MO == 'NO', .N] +
  fem_2017_2019_data[HADSEX == 'NO, R NEVER HAD INTERCOURSE', .N]
```

The respondents with `NA` for MTHUSE3 are respondents with "NO" for `SEX3MO` plus the respondents with "NO, R NEVER HAD INTERCOURSE" for `HADSEX`. Both these variables must be checked to estimate females who are not currently sexually active with a male.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
collect_estimate(
  svyci(
    ~I(SEX3MO == 'NO' | HADSEX == 'NO, R NEVER HAD INTERCOURSE'),
    subset(fem_2017_2019_svy, meth3m_count == 0),
    svytotal
  )[level == TRUE],
  title = 'who did not have intercourse with male in previous 3 months',
  type = 'total',
  domain = 'females not currently using contraception' 
) |> kable()
```

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
collect_estimate(
  svyci(
    ~I(SEX3MO == 'NO' | HADSEX == 'NO, R NEVER HAD INTERCOURSE'),
    subset(fem_2017_2019_svy, meth3m_count == 0),
    svymean
  )[level == TRUE],
  title = 'who did not have intercourse with male in previous 3 months',
  type = 'proportion',
  domain = 'females not currently using contraception' 
) |> kable()
```

Females not currently sexually active with a male accounts for the majority not using contraception. This can be further decomposed by never had sex with male versus just not currently.


#### Pregnant

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[, tablena(RCURPREG)] |> kable()
```

The pregnancy recode variable is straightforward.

Going forward, estimates of those not currently using contraception will be cumulatively exclusive of previous estimates. For instance, those who are both pregnant and not currently sexually active will be counted once as not currently sexually active. Only those preganant and currently sexually active will be included in the next estimate.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
collect_estimate(
  svyci(
    ~I(RCURPREG == 'YES (CURRENTLY PREGNANT)' & SEX3MO == 'YES'),
    subset(fem_2017_2019_svy, meth3m_count == 0),
    svytotal
  )[level == TRUE],
  title = 'who are currently pregnant, and had intercourse with male in previous 3 months',
  type = 'total',
  domain = 'females not currently using contraception' 
) |> kable()
```

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
collect_estimate(
  svyci(
    ~I(RCURPREG == 'YES (CURRENTLY PREGNANT)' & SEX3MO == 'YES'),
    subset(fem_2017_2019_svy, meth3m_count == 0),
    svymean
  )[level == TRUE],
  title = 'who currently pregnant, and had intercourse with male in previous 3 months',
  type = 'proportion',
  domain = 'females not currently using contraception' 
) |> kable()
```


#### Reason for Not Using Contraception

Section EH are questions asked of respondent to determine reason for not using contraception. The universe is 

> Applicable if R is not currently pregnant (currpreg = 5) and R had sex in month of interview (EC-8 MONSX through MONSX48 corresponding to cmintvw = 1) and R is not sterilized nor sterile [(rstrstat ne 1 or 2) and (ED-6 METHX1 through METHX192 corresponding to cmintvw ne 6)] and R did not use a method in month of interview (currmeth1 = 1)

This might not line up nicely with the `MTHUSE3` and `SEX3MO` variables, since Section EH is asked for those who had sex with a male in the current month and `MTHUSE3` and `SEX3MO` refer to past 3 months. Once analysis gets to Section EH, different variables will have to be used in order to make the denominator consistent.


#### Infertile Due to Reasons Others Than Contraception

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  as.integer(MTHUSE3) %in% 2:3 & SEX3MO == 'YES' & as.integer(FECUND) == 1,
  .(
    CASEID,
    DATFEMOP_Y,
    DATFEMOP_Y2,
    DATFEMOP_Y3,
    FECUND,
    MTHUSE3,
    PSURGSTR,
    RSURGSTR,
    STRLOPER,
    meth3m_count
  )
] |> kable()
```


This appears inconsistent. It shouldn't be possible to have `FECUND` of "SURGICALLY STERILE, CONTRACEPTIVE" and to not have used a contraceptive at last intercourse, unless, perhaps, the surgery happened in between the last intercourse and the interview, which seems unlikely.

The `DATFEMOP_Y` series was checked to see if these respondents' apparent contradiction is due to sterilizing operations occurring in the interval between last intercourse and the NSFG interview. Since many sterilizing operations occurred years earlier than the interview, this is not the case.

It appears that the issue with these problem cases is due to how `FECUND` encodes contraceptive intent. Firstly, respondents are only asked about motives for sterilizing operations if the operation occurred in the five years preceding the interview. Any tubal ligations and vasectomies for which there is no motive information, either because the respondents did not answer the motive questions or because the operation occurred more than five years previous, are assumed to have contraceptive intent.

Furthermore, among those sterilizing operations for which there is motive information, the "burden of proof" in the `FECUND` recode is on non-contraceptive intent. For instance, if the respondent indicates at the time of the operation, respondent had all the children respondent wanted (`RHADALL`), then `FECUND` is encoded as contraceptive intent.

Basically, the NSFG recodes are premised on the proposition that tubal ligations and vasectomies are usually done for contraceptive reasons, and aggressively categorizes them as such. However, respondents sometimes do not report their sterilizing operations as a contraceptive method used at least intercourse.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[, tablena(FECUND)] |> kable()
```

Because of the aggressive recoding, there are relatively few respondents classified as "SURGICALLY STERILE, NONCONTRACEPTIVE."

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  as.integer(MTHUSE3) %in% 2:3 & SEX3MO == 'YES' & as.integer(FECUND) == 1,
  tablena(STRLOPER)
] |> kable()
```

Tubal ligation is by far the most common reason for having a `FECUND` code of 1 among the problem cases.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  as.integer(MTHUSE3) %in% 2:3 & SEX3MO == 'YES' & as.integer(FECUND) == 1 & STRLOPER == 'TUBAL LIGATION OR STERILIZATION',
  .(
    CASEID,
    DATFEMOP_Y,
    FMEDREAS1,
    FMEDREAS2,
    FMEDREAS3,
    FMEDREAS4,
    RHADALL,
    STRLOPER,
    meth3m_count
  )
] |> kable()
```

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  as.integer(MTHUSE3) %in% 2:3 & SEX3MO == 'YES' & as.integer(FECUND) == 1 & STRLOPER == 'TUBAL LIGATION OR STERILIZATION',
  tablena(FMEDREAS1)
] |> kable()
```

Most of the tubal ligations occurred earlier than 5 years before the interview or did not have motive questions answered. Among known motives, only 1 cites medical problems.

I think I'll join with the NSFG recoding team and just count any tubal ligation still in effect as a current contraceptive method, and set the `using3m_meth4` variable to `TRUE` for these respondents.

However, this is unsound for female respondent's who are married or cohabitating and whose partners have vasectomies, because there is the possibility of sexual intercourse with someone not the reported partner. For exploration of this, see "Married or Cohabitating with Surgically Sterile Partner."

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  as.integer(MTHUSE3) %in% 2:3 & SEX3MO == 'YES' & STRLOPER == 'HYSTERECTOMY',
  .(
    CASEID,
    DATFEMOP_Y2,
    FMEDREAS7,
    FMEDREAS8,
    FMEDREAS9,
    FMEDREAS10,
    FMEDREAS11,
    RHADALL,
    STRLOPER,
    meth3m_count
  )
] |> kable()
```

The 3 hysterectomies among the problem cases were all for medical problems.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  STRLOPER == 'HYSTERECTOMY',
  tablena(FMEDREAS7)
] |> kable()
```

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  STRLOPER == 'HYSTERECTOMY',
  tablena(FMEDREAS8)
] |> kable()
```

Hysterectomies generally appear to be done mostly for medical reasons.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  as.integer(MTHUSE3) %in% 2:3 & SEX3MO == 'YES' & STRLOPER == 'OTHER OPERATION OR TYPE UNKNOWN',
  .(
    CASEID,
    DATFEMOP_Y4,
    FMEDREAS19,
    FMEDREAS20,
    FMEDREAS21,
    RHADALL,
    STRLOPER,
    meth3m_count
  )
] |> kable()
```

The 2 other operations among the problem cases are split was to whether they were done for medical reasons.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  STRLOPER == 'OTHER OPERATION OR TYPE UNKNOWN',
  tablena(FMEDREAS19),
] |> kable()
```

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  STRLOPER == 'OTHER OPERATION OR TYPE UNKNOWN',
  tablena(FMEDREAS20),
] |> kable()
```

More generally, for what motives are known, other operations appear to be mostly for medical reasons.

I think the strategy going forward should be to recode any female respondents who have tubal ligations that have not been reversed as currently using tubal ligation as a method of contraception, but to leave all other sterilizing operations as is.


##### Infertile Due to Noncontraceptive Surgery

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}

  title = 'who are infertile due to noncontraceptive surgery, not currently pregnant, and had intercourse with male in previous 3 months',
  type = 'proportion',
  domain = 'females not currently using contraception'
) |> kable()
```

This is an awfully low estimate.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  (HYST == 'YES' | OVAREM == 'YES' | 'OTHR' == 'YES') &
    SEX3MO == 'YES',
  tablena(meth3m_count)

```

It seems that most females who have had sterilizing procedures and are sexually active are still using contraception. That's surprising.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}

    ),
    svyciprop

  title = 'currently using contraception',

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}

        subset(
          fem_2017_2019_svy,
          SEX3MO == 'YES' & (HYST == 'YES' | OVAREM == 'YES' | 'OTHR' == 'YES')
        ),
        svyciprop
      )[
        , .(level = x, estimate, se, `2.5 %`, `97.5 %`)
      ]
    }
  ))[

I see. It seems as though tubal ligation has become a standard practice whenever a hysterectomy, etc, is done. I'm guessing this is to try to avoid ectopic pregnancies.


##### Otherwise Physically Infertile

fem_2017_2019_data[

There are some respondents in this category. The universe for the `POSIBLPGN` variable are respondents neither surgically sterile nor pregnant, so this is simple to estimate.

##### Married or Cohabitating with Physically Infertile Partner

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}

```

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}

      P1YRELP == 'Current cohabiting partner'
  )
] |> kable()
```

Care must be taken when it is reported that respondent's husband or cohabitating partner is physically infertile that last intercourse was with husband or cohabitating partner.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
collect_estimate(
  svyci(
    ~I(
      SEX3MO == 'YES' & POSIBLPG == 'Yes' & POSIBLMN == 'No' & (

          P1YRELP == 'Current cohabiting partner'
      )
    ),
    subset(fem_2017_2019_svy, meth3m_count == 0),
    svytotal
  )[level == TRUE],
  title = 'who are married or cohabitating with physically infertile partner, not themselves infertile, not currently pregnant, and had intercourse with male in previous 3 months',

```

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}

      RCURPREG == 'NO (NOT CURRENTLY PREGNANT)' &
      POSIBLPG == 'Yes' &
      POSIBLMN == 'No' & (
        P1YRELP == 'Current husband or (current husband from whom she is separated)' |
        P1YRELP == 'Current cohabiting partner'
      )
    ),
    subset(fem_2017_2019_svy, meth3m_count == 0),
    svyciprop
  ),
  title = 'who are married or cohabitating with physically infertile partner, not themselves infertile, not currently pregnant, and had intercourse with male in previous 3 months',
  type = 'proportion',
  domain = 'females not currently using contraception'
) |> kable()
```

This case is very rare.


##### Married or Cohabitating with Surgically Sterile Partner

Reasons for male sterilizing operations are only asked if the operation occurred within 5 years of the interview and if the female respondent was in a relationship with the husband or cohabitating partner at the time of the operation.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[PSURGSTR == 'YES', tablena(VASECT)] |> kable()
fem_2017_2019_data[VASECT == 'YES', tablena(PSURGSTR)] |> kable()
```

It appears that all sterilizing operations reported for husband or cohabitating partners are vasectomies. The only difference between `PSURGSTR` and `VASECT` is that `VASECT`'s universe is respondents currently married or cohabitating whereas `PSURGSTR`'s universe is all respondents.

Given this, vasectomies among husbands and cohabitating partners will be handled similarly to tubal ligations. If a female respondent's last sexual intercourse was with H/CP and H/CP is reported to have a vasectomy, then force `using3m_meth3` to be `TRUE`.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  as.integer(MTHUSE3) %in% 2:3 &
    (
      P1YRELP == 'Current husband or (current husband from whom she is separated)' |
        P1YRELP == 'Current cohabiting partner'
    ) &
    PSURGSTR == 'YES',
  .(
    CASEID,
    MTHUSE3,
    SEX3MO,
    PSURGSTR,
    P1YRELP,
    meth3m_count
  )
] |> kable()
```

This changes two respondents' contraceptive statuses.


#### Trying to Become Pregnant

This is encoded in either `WYNOTUSE` or `WYNOLSTP`. It is encoded in `WYNOTUSE` if respondent had sexual intercourse in month of interview and `WYNOLSTP` otherwise.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  SEX3MO == 'YES' &
    meth3m_count == 0 &
    RCURPREG == 'NO (NOT CURRENTLY PREGNANT)' &
    POSIBLPG == 'Yes' &
    !(
      POSIBLMN == 'No' & (
        P1YRELP == 'Current husband or (current husband from whom she is separated)' |
          P1YRELP == 'Current cohabiting partner'
      )
    ),
  table(WYNOTUSE, WYNOLSTP)
]
```

It is slightly troubling that there is some contradiction between `WYNOLSTP` and `WYNOTUSE`. Is it the case that "last intercourse with last partner in the past 12 months" means something different than last intercourse in the past 3 months? For instance, does the later include "non-partner" intercourse?

More troubling, why is it the case that there are 71 respondents with "No answer provided" for both `WYNOTUSE` and `WYNOLSTOP`? To determine this requires investigating the universes of both variables.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  SEX3MO == 'YES' &
    meth3m_count == 0 &
    RCURPREG == 'NO (NOT CURRENTLY PREGNANT)' &
    POSIBLPG == 'Yes' &
    !(
      POSIBLMN == 'No' & (
        P1YRELP == 'Current husband or (current husband from whom she is separated)' |
          P1YRELP == 'Current cohabiting partner'
      )
    ) &
    WYNOTUSE == 'No answer provided' &
    WYNOLSTP == 'No answer provided',
  .(
    CASEID,
    MTHUSE12,
    USELSTP,
    CMLSEX,
    CMINTVW,
    WYNOLSTP_universe = (USELSTP != 1 & CMLSEX != CMINTVW)
  )
] |> kable()
```

I see. The abundance of "No answer provided" values for `WYNOLSTP` seems to be due to it being a raw, rather than recode, variable and so not imputed. There are many instances `NA` values for variables used to determine the universe of `WYNOLSTP`. This is likely due to item nonresponse upstream of the `USELSTP` and `CMLSEX` questions pertaining to sexual history. The `WYNOLSTP` was not asked of respondents who had missing values for `USELSTP` or `CMLSEX`.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  SEX3MO == 'YES' &
    meth3m_count == 0 &
    RCURPREG == 'NO (NOT CURRENTLY PREGNANT)' &
    POSIBLPG == 'Yes' &
    !(
      POSIBLMN == 'No' & (
        P1YRELP == 'Current husband or (current husband from whom she is separated)' |
          P1YRELP == 'Current cohabiting partner'
      )
    ) &
    WYNOTUSE == 'No answer provided' &
    WYNOLSTP == 'No answer provided' &
    !(USELSTP != 1 & CMLSEX != CMINTVW),
  .(
    CASEID,
    CURRPREG,
    CMINTVW,
    RSTRSTAT,
    CURRMETH1,
    METH3M1,
    SEX3MO,
    MTHUSE3,
    WYNOTUSE_universe = (
      CURRPREG == 5 &
      !is.element(RSTRSTAT, 1:2) &
      CURRMETH1 == 1
    )
  )
] |> kable()
```

Most of the "No answer provided" values for `WYNOTUSE`, on the other hand, appear to be due to a contradiction between `CURRMETH1` and `MTHUSE3`, with `CURRMETH1` reporting a contraceptive method used and `MTHUSE3` reporting no contraceptive method used. This is more troubling.

According to documentations `CURRMETH1` is based on the ED-6 series of questions about method history, which are the `METHX` variables that ask what method(s) were used in specific months. `MTHUSE3` on the other hand is based on either section EF-1 (`USELSTP`, `WYNOLSTP`, and `HPLSTP` variables) or EB series, which pertain to the first method(s) ever used. Thus, there appears to be some contradiction in the answers given by respondents, or there is some contradiction introduced by imputation or peturbation.

The larger issue is the inconsistency between `CURRMETH` and `MTHUSE3` and the `METH3M`.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
as.data.table(fem_2017_2019_data[
  as.integer(CURRMETH1) != 1 &
  SEX3MO == 'YES' &
  MTHUSE3 != 'USED A METHOD AT LAST INTERCOURSE IN PAST 3 MONTHS',
  table(CURRMETH1)
])[N > 0][order(-N)] |> kable()
```

What may be going on here is that `CURRMETH` reflects what method(s) were reported as being used during the month of the interview, whereas `MTHUSE3` and the `METH3M` series ask more specifically the method(s) used at the last intercourse before the interview. It may be that respondents are using contraceptive methods, but inconsistently, and so did use one or more methods during the month of the interview, but just not at the last intercourse. This is consistent with many of the `CURRMETH1` values in the problem set being condom or withdrawal.

Less apparent are more long-term contraceptive methods such as implants or IUDs being reported in this consistency. Perhaps in these cases the implant or IUD is actually inserted the month of the interview, after last intercourse. Or perhaps these are actual logical inconsistencies.

There isn't a lot of information on consistency of contraceptive usage in the NSFG. There is just Section EL.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  as.integer(CURRMETH1) != 1 &
  SEX3MO == 'YES' &
  MTHUSE3 != 'USED A METHOD AT LAST INTERCOURSE IN PAST 3 MONTHS',
  tablena(PXNOFREQ)
] |> kable()
```

Those with conflicting `CURRMETH` and `MTHUSE3` variables don't report using contraceptive methods during the past 12 months "every time" very often. This is indirect evidence that is consistent with the hypothesis that the discrepancy is due to inconsistent contraceptive usage.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  as.integer(CURRMETH1) != 1 &
  SEX3MO == 'YES' &
  MTHUSE3 != 'USED A METHOD AT LAST INTERCOURSE IN PAST 3 MONTHS' &
  PST4WKSX %in% 2:995,
  tablena(PSWKCOND2 / PST4WKSX)
] |> kable()
```

Among those in the problem group who report having sexual intercourse multiple times via `PST4WKSX` and report using condoms, the vast majority used condoms none of the time.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  CURRMETH1 == 'Condom' &
    PST4WKSX %in% 2:995,
  tablena(PSWKCOND2 / PST4WKSX)
] |> kable()
```

It seems like reported condom use generally tends to either all-or-nothing extreme.

After much investigation, I think it is acceptable to attribute inconsistency between `CURRMETH` and `METH3M` to respondents not using their reported contraceptive methods (`CURRMETH`) during their last sexual intercourse (`METH3M`).

This informs the earlier question about `NA` values for `WYNOTUSE` and `WYNOLSTP`.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  SEX3MO == 'YES' &
    meth3m_count == 0 &
    RCURPREG == 'NO (NOT CURRENTLY PREGNANT)' &
    POSIBLPG == 'Yes' &
    !(
      POSIBLMN == 'No' & (
        P1YRELP == 'Current husband or (current husband from whom she is separated)' |
          P1YRELP == 'Current cohabiting partner'
      )
    ) &
    WYNOTUSE == 'No answer provided' &
    WYNOLSTP == 'No answer provided'
    ,
  tablena(as.integer(CURRMETH1) %in% 2:21)
] |> kable()
```

A majority of the respondents for which both `WYNOTUSE` and `WYNOLSTP` are `NA` report currently using a contraceptive method (though not at last intercourse). This majority can be considered to be not trying to get pregnant.

For the rest, they have `NA` values because they were not included in the universe for both `WYNOTUSE` and `WYNOLSTP`.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  SEX3MO == 'YES' &
    meth3m_count == 0 &
    RCURPREG == 'NO (NOT CURRENTLY PREGNANT)' &
    POSIBLPG == 'Yes' &
    !(
      POSIBLMN == 'No' & (
        P1YRELP == 'Current husband or (current husband from whom she is separated)' |
          P1YRELP == 'Current cohabiting partner'
      )
    ) &
    WYNOTUSE == 'No answer provided' &
    WYNOLSTP == 'No answer provided' &
    !is.element(as.integer(CURRMETH1), 2:21)
    ,
  tablena(INTENT)
] |> kable()
```

Of the remaining 31 respondents, about half do not intent to have (more) children.

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  SEX3MO == 'YES' &
    meth3m_count == 0 &
    RCURPREG == 'NO (NOT CURRENTLY PREGNANT)' &
    POSIBLPG == 'Yes' &
    !(
      POSIBLMN == 'No' & (
        P1YRELP == 'Current husband or (current husband from whom she is separated)' |
          P1YRELP == 'Current cohabiting partner'
      )
    ) &
    WYNOTUSE == 'No answer provided' &
    WYNOLSTP == 'No answer provided' &
    !is.element(as.integer(CURRMETH1), 2:21) &
    INTENT == 'R DOES NOT INTEND TO HAVE (MORE) CHILDREN'
  ,
  tablena(REACTSLF)
] |> kable()
```

Of the remaining who do intend to have (more) children, most would be pleased if they discovered they were pregnant, but 2 would be upset and 4 do not have reaction information. This is of course indirect evidence about _current intent_ to have a child. Since this is a small enough number of respondents and there isn't definitive evidence either way, I will not count these respondents as currently intending to have a child.

Thus, respondents who are `NA` for both `WYNOTUSE` and `WYNOLSTP` will be considered as "No" for both.

I was expecting similar results to that for females. The overall pattern is similar, but there is a noticeable difference in reported use of tubal ligation as a method of contraception. About half as many men report tubal ligation as a current method of contraception as do women. This may be due to lack of reporting. I should at least try to compensate by going through and counting wives/cohabitating partners with tubal ligations who were the last sex partners.

The other immediately noticeable difference is in calendar rhythm method.

I wonder if both of these are due to males not thinking about what their partners are doing?


#### "Something Else"

I spent about half an hour looking through the documentation to see if respondents were asked, when they answered "something else," what "something else" meant, but I could not find anything. This doesn't necessarily mean it isn't in the NSFG somewhere. There are _a lot_ of variables in the data set.
