	abstract = {Periodic estimation of the incidence of global unintended pregnancy can help demonstrate the need for and impact of family planning programs. We draw upon multiple sources of data to estimate pregnancy incidence by intention status and outcome at worldwide, regional, and subregional levels in 2012 and to assess recent trends using previously published estimates for 2008 and 1995. We find that 213 million pregnancies occurred in 2012, up slightly from 211 million in 2008. The global pregnancy rate decreased only slightly from 2008 to 2012, after declining substantially between 1995 and 2008. Eighty-five million pregnancies, representing 40 percent of all pregnancies, were unintended in 2012. Of these, 50 percent ended in abortion, 13 percent ended in miscarriage, and 38 percent resulted in an unplanned birth. The unintended pregnancy rate continued to decline in Africa and in the Latin America and Caribbean region. If the aims of the London Summit on Family Planning are carried out, the incidence of unwanted and mistimed pregnancies should decline in the coming years.},

	abstract = {Analysis of data from the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth--corrected for the underreporting of abortion--reveals that contraceptive failure during the first year of use remains a serious problem in the United States, contributing substantially to unintended pregnancy. The pill continues to be the most effective reversible method for which data were available (8\% of users accidentally became pregnant during the first year of use), followed by the condom (15\%). Periodic abstinence is the method most likely to fail (26\%), but accidental pregnancy is also relatively common among women using spermicides (25\%). Failure rates vary more by user characteristics such as age, marital status and poverty status than by method, suggesting the extent to which failure results from improper and irregular use rather than from the inherent limitations of the method.},

	abstract = {A multivariate life-table analysis of national survey data from 1982 indicates that among currently married women, the pill and IUD have the lowest use-failure rates. During the first year of use, about three percent of pill users and six percent of IUD users experience an unintended pregnancy. Failure rates for the remaining methods range from 14 percent for the condom to 22 percent for spermicides; between these lie rhythm and natural family planning (16 percent), the diaphragm (17 percent) and other methods, mainly withdrawal, douche and abstinence. Married women using no contraceptive method experience an unintended pregnancy rate of 40 percent during the first year of unprotected intercourse. A woman's age, pregnancy intention (either to delay or to prevent births), parity and income all have significant effects on the risk of unintended pregnancy. The risk generally declines with age, except for women attempting to prevent an unwanted pregnancy, among whom women under 20 have lower failure rates than do those 20-29 years of age. As expected, women attempting to prevent an unwanted pregnancy have lower failure rates than do those seeking to delay a wanted pregnancy, with the difference being greatest for women under 20 years of age and smallest for 20-29-year-olds. Use-failure rates among low-income women are higher than those among women with larger family incomes, while low-parity women have lower failure rates than do women of higher parity. On average, standardized use-failure rates for single women are lower than those for married women, probably because of a lower average level of intercourse among single women. In addition, these rates are understated because of the substantial underreporting of abortion among single women; if abortion reporting were complete, failure rates would be about 1.4 times as high as they appear here, and thus would be close to those of married women. Differences in the risk of unintended pregnancy among single women show a number of similarities with those seen among married women: Use of the pill and IUD is associated with the lowest failure rates, reliance on the condom is associated with intermediate failure rates, and use of spermicides is linked with the highest failure rates. However, while rhythm and the diaphragm exhibit use-failure rates that are among the highest found for single women, failure rates for these methods are at intermediate levels among married women. Another exception is for "other" methods, for which use-failure rates are intermediate among single women but very high among married women. One-third of single women who use no contraceptive method have an unintended pregnancy during the first year of unprotected intercourse. The overall effects of family income and parity are consistent among married and single women, but the effects of age, race and contraceptive intention differ.},
