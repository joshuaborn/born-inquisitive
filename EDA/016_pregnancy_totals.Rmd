## Live Births

Rather than using [CDC WONDER](https://wonder.cdc.gov/) or the [public use microdata files for births](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm), I found a visualization on the NCHS website that reported total births per year and downloaded the data set for it. Once I get into subdomains, I will have to look for other ways to get counts, either via the microdata or be going through tables in published NCHS reports.

```{r}
vital_births <- fread(here('data/NCHS_-_Births_and_General_Fertility_Rates__United_States.csv'))
kable(vital_births)
```

## Induced Abortions


## Fetal Deaths (of 20 Weeks Gestational Age or Above)
