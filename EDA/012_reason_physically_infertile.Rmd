# Universe of `POSIBLPG`

```{r, dependson='fem-load-data'}
fem_2017_2019$Data[
  RSURGSTR == 5 & CURRPREG == 5,
  tablena(POSIBLPG)
] |> kable()
```

```{r, dependson='fem-load-data'}
fem_2017_2019$Data[
  !is.na(POSIBLPG),
  table(RSURGSTR, CURRPREG)
]
```

For the most part, the actual universe of `POSIBLPG` matches what is in the codebook. There is one respondent that has a `POSIBLPG` response, but is also surgically sterile according to `RSURGSTR`. This is the one and only exception.


# Universe of `REASIMPR` in Domain of Interest

```{r, dependson='fem-process-data'}
fem_2017_2019$Data[
  fem_2017_2019_data[, curr_use == 'Physically unable to conceive'],
  tablena(REASIMPR)
] |> kable()
```

Since the 'Physically unable to conceive' status is set based on `POSIBLPG`, it should not be surprising that `REASIMPR` is fully specified for the respondents with this status.


# Universe of `REASIMPP` in Domain of Interest

```{r, dependson='fem-process-data'}
fem_2017_2019$Data[
  fem_2017_2019_data[
    , curr_use == 'Last intercourse was with partner who is physically unable to conceive'
  ],
  tablena(REASIMPP)
] |> kable()
```

Likewise, `REASIMPP` is fully specified for the "Last intercourse was with partner who is physically unable to conceive" status.
