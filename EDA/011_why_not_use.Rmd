# Universe Check of `WHYNOTUSE`

```{r, dependson='fem-process-data'}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  CURRPREG == 5 &
    had_sex_this_month &
    !is.element(RSTRSTAT, 1:2) &
    !sterilized &
    CURRMETH1 == 1,
  table(WYNOTUSE)
] |> kable()
```

It appears the universe for `WYNOTUSE` is once again not as expected from the codebook.

These are the rows for which there is a `WYNOTUSE` value, but aren't in the supposed universe for `WYNOTUSE`:

```{r, dependson='fem-process-data'}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  WYNOTUSE != 'No answer provided',
  .(
    CASEID,
    CMINTVW,
    CURRPREG,
    MONSX,
    CMMONSX,
    had_sex_this_month,
    RSTRSTAT,
    sterilized,
    CURRMETH1,
    universe = (
      CURRPREG == 5 &
      had_sex_this_month &
      !is.element(RSTRSTAT, 1:2) &
      !sterilized &
      CURRMETH1 == 1
    )
  )
][!(universe)] |> kable()
```

These rows have the correct values for `CURRPREG`, `CURRMETH1`, and whether sterilized based on `METHX` series. However, some of these respondents are have "No" or "Don't know" for whether had intercourse this month based on the `MONSX` series, and some of these respondents are determined to be nonsurgically sterile based on `RSTRSTAT`.

These are the rows that are in the supposed universe for `WYNOTUSE`, but do not have a `WYNOTUSE` value:

```{r, dependson='fem-process-data'}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  WYNOTUSE == 'No answer provided',
  .(
    CASEID,
    CMINTVW,
    CURRPREG,
    MONSX,
    CMMONSX,
    had_sex_this_month,
    RSTRSTAT,
    sterilized,
    CURRMETH1,
    universe = (
      CURRPREG == 5 &
      had_sex_this_month &
      !is.element(RSTRSTAT, 1:2) &
      !sterilized &
      CURRMETH1 == 1
    )
  )
][(universe)] |> kable()
```

I'm going to proceed with this inconsistency for now, pretending that the universe for `WYNOTUSE` and related variables is as specified in the codebook.

## Universe Check of `WHYNOTPG1`

## Format Specifications of `WHYNOTPGF` and Encoding Issue

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_formats[format_name == 'WHYNOTPGF'] |> kable()
```

There are 6 rows that have the value `13` for `WHYNOTPG1`, which is not defined in the `WHYNOTPGF` format. Because of this, they get loaded as `NA` values when `WHYNOTPG1` is factorized.

According to the codebook, `13` should be mapped to "No menstrual cycle or menstrual irregularity."

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_formats[factor_label == 'No menstrual cycle or menstrual irregularity'] |> kable()
```

This value appears to be missing entirely.

Manually adding the row to the `fem_2017_2019_formats` in the fem-load-data block fixes this issue.

## Reverse Universe Check of `WHYNOTPG1`

```{r, dependson=c('fem-process-data')}
fem_2017_2019_data[
  WHYNOTPG1 != 'No answer provided',
  tablena(nonuse_reason2)
] |> kable()
```

The `WHYNOTPG1` is specified if and only if `nonuse_reason2` is true, as expected.
