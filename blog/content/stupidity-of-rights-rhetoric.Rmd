## Introduction

One of the things that troubles me about contemporary culture is that the state of discourse is public abominable. Nearly every day I am confronted with more people who are uninformed, have nothing insightful to share, but will nonetheless share their snarky, ignorant [partisan demagoguery](/they-them-those-people-and-the-fallacy-of-partisan-demagoguery.html) with the rest of the world.

I am certainly not the first to decry the decline in the quality of public discourse. Jonathan Haidt has made a career as a public intellectual criticizing this decline, and he has attributed much of it to the rise of social media. [@haidt_why_2022]  While the rise of social media might be one causal factor in the decline of public discourse, I notice the decline in my everyday experience even though I scrupulously avoid social media like the plague that it is.

In this article I allege that the poverty in the quality of public discourse we are experiencing today is caused, at least in part, by a feature of United States political culture that goes back much farther than the past few decades in which social media has become more salient in public life -- a feature that Jonathan Haidt celebrates rather than censures. Specifically, I believe the rhetoric of "rights" is detrimental to public discourse.


* Wisdom of crowds versus madness of crowds
  * Know own opinion
    * Value judgments
    * Relevant facts
  * Know other, disagreeing opinions
  * Intrinsic versus instrumental goods
* How "rights" rhetoric poisons public discourse
  * Normative, not description, and thus not factual
  * Loaded term that poisons public discourse with self-righteousness
  * Inverts instrumental good versus final good, e.g., free speech
  * Circular argument
* Two kinds of "rights"
  * Legal fiction
  * Complete fantasy, e.g., "human rights"
