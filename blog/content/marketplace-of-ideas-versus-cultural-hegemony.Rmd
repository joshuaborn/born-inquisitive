## The Marketplace of Ideas

* Free speech
* Persuasion
* Appeal to different values
* Information
* Diversity of viewpoints
* Values-free ideal


## Cultural Hegemony

* Silence opposition
  * Censorship
  * Getting people fired (i.e., "cancellation")
* Misrepresent opposing views
* Frame disagreement binary
* Defame others
* More subtle
  * Don't hire or promote people with viewpoints that differ from the orthodoxy
  * Create incentives in social structures for people to adopt the orthodoxy


## The University and the _Quid Pro Quo_ of Modern Society

* Left-wing capture of universities
* People want to make more money and have job security
* Some true believers, many more going along with the crowd, few openly going against the grain
* Exodus of working class from the left-wing
