The United States of America is a heavily polarized, partisan place. However, as I described in my [review](/myth-of-left-and-right.html) of _The Myth of Left and Right_ by Hyrum and Verlan Lewis [-@lewis_myth_2023], I do not believe the left-right spectrum has any utility as a [description of socio-political viewpoints](when-left-wing-and-right-wing-are-and-arent-substantive-criticism.html) in the United States. Therefore, the left-right spectrum does not explain this partisan polarization.

This raises the question of how to understand the polarization that characterizes American politics. I discovered what I believe to be the best answer to this question a couple of years ago when listening to [episode 40 of season 3 of _Conversations with Coleman_](https://pca.st/1l7zid0r) in which Coleman Hughes interviewed David Sacks.

Coleman Hughes is a columnist, podcaster, and book author who comments on race politics in the United States, and David Sacks is an entrepreneur in the software industry who was the founding CEO of PayPal. However, the explanation of political polarization in the United States does not come directly from either David Sacks or Coleman Hughes, but from the work of [Ruy Teixeira](https://substack.com/@theliberalpatriot), which they discussed.

Ruy Texeira is a political scientist and co-author of _The Emerging Democratic Majority_ in 2002 and of _Where Have All the Democrats Gone?_ in 2023. The former 2002 book predicted that the Democrats would soon have a national voting majority. This did not happen, which led to the latter 2023 book and his ongoing political science work.

The phenomenon that explains polarization in the United States is that of _cultural hegemony._ This cultural hegemony emerges out of the university system in the United States, and is predicated on the institutional dominance of the professional class.


## Voter Polarization between the Professional Class and the Working Class

Ruy Texeira uses the label "professional class" for those in the United States who have a four-year degree from a university and uses the label "working class" as those who do not. The United States is a majority working class country, with about two-thirds of the United States working class by this definition.

According to the work of Ruy Texeira, the biggest polarization in the United States in party preference and in viewpoints on numerous issues occurs not between men and women, between White Americans and Black Americans, between Latinos and non-Latinos, etc. Rather, the biggest gaps in voting preferences occur between the professional class voters and working class voters.

Texeira's explanation for the lack of emergence a clear national majority voting for Democrats as predicted in his 2002 book is that working class voters are leaving the Democratic Party, despite the Democratic Party being the twentieth century "home" for working class voters.

There are probably many explanations for this phenomenon. For instance, Democrats in the 1990s moved away from New Deal and Great Society economic policies in favor of "neo-liberal" economic policies that favored free trade. For instance, public dissatisfaction, especially among working-class voters, with the bipartisan support for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) almost led to third-party candidate Ross Perot being elected president in 1996.

However, one the more enduring reasons Democrats have lost much of the working class vote is that the party caters heavily to the interests, cultural values, and biases of the professional class, either neglecting the viewpoints of the working class or expressing outright contempt toward working class voters.


## The University as the Origin of the Cultural Hegemony

The cultural hegemony we experience in the United States has its origin in the university system. American universities are very hierarchical and elitist. Graduate students and post-doctoral fellows gravitate to the most highly ranked universities out of necessity in order to advance their careers. Most professors even at more lowly ranked universities come from the most highly ranked universities in some way. There is a glut of individuals who hold PhDs, and very few jobs for them in academia. Thus, there is a scramble among academics to get names like "Harvard" or "Stanford" or "Yale" or "UC Berkeley" on their _curricula vitae._

Therefore, the culture of elite universities trickles down throughout the university system. Whatever becomes popular at the Ivy league and other prestigious universities eventually becomes popular throughout the university system.

Furthermore, almost all the institutional leadership positions in the United States, whether in Fortune 500 companies or government, are occupied by members of the professional class, i.e., by people who have at least four-year university degrees. Thus, _almost all positions of leadership_ in the United States are occupied by people who are indoctrinated in the cultural biases that come down on high from a select few.

This phenomenon is exacerbated by a positive feedback loop created by the occupation of journalist becoming a professional-class occupation instead of a blue collar, work-class occupation. Information via media is filtered and framed way in which the public receives information is framed by the biases of a culture that ultimately comes from a few rich or prestigious people.


## Cultural Hegemony Explains Polarization in the United States

As David Sacks discussed on his _Conversations with Coleman_ podcast:

> America is a predominantly working class country. It's about two-thirds working class, about one-third professional class. But it's all the college graduates who control the institutions because you do need these credentials and degrees. And I think this is fundamentally what is creating all of the sense of stress and fracture in our society, is that the professional class runs all the institutions, including the colleges, for their benefit and in accordance with their ideology. And it is not the same ideology as the majority of the country. And that sets up in a democracy that is unsustainable somehow. And it sets up this, I think this fundamentally is the battle line of what's going on in our society. 

The most dramatic polarization we see in the United States is between the professional class and the working class, and this is because the professional class has more exposure to the cultural hegemony, while the working class has less exposure to the cultural hegemony. Furthermore, the working class outnumbers the professional class, but the professional class wields more power than the working class, sowing discord.

The working class might poll more "conservative" on a social issue, depending on how the pollsters frame the issue and what (ultimately arbitrary) definition of "conservative" is being used. The professional class might poll more "left-wing" than the working class on an issue, based an fleeting and arbitrary characterizations of the left-right spectrum. But all of these labels miss the point that the schism itself is caused by the professional-class cultural hegemony phenomenon.

If the views of the pseudo-aristocracy that runs the Ivy League and the _New York Times_ were "right-wing" or "conservative," then this schism in American society would still exist, but with a reversing of the labels. The source of the polarization and division is the amount of exposure to the cultural hegemony people receive and the amount of power they have in society by virtue of money and institutional leadership.


## Divisions within the Professional Class

People are motivated to expose themselves to the cultural hegemony because people with four-year university degrees tend to have better economic outcomes than those who do not. As David Sacks discussed:

> And so the fundamental quid pro quo of our civilization is that if you want the economic and social advancement that a college degree brings you, you have to submit to voluntary re-education for four years, maybe longer. And I tend to think that so many of our political divides are essentially downstream of this problem. 

Even though a lot of people are motivated by the socio-economic structures of our society to _expose_ themselves to the cultural hegemony, the degree to which individuals _acquiesce_ to the hegemony varies. Coleman Hughes is an alumnus of Columbia University, and David Sacks is an alumnus of Stanford University, so they both have direct experience to the cultural hegemony, and they both have rebelled against it in some way. As David Sacks discussed:

> Now, I do think that there are different reactions that people have to this phenomenon. I tend to think there's three types of students or student reactions to this.
> 
> So I tend to think that the first is that you can rebel against it. I tend to think that maybe 1% of the students do this and then, and those people tend to become either founders, which is why I can stay in business having the views I have, or they tend to become kind of more conservative or independent media personalities.
>
> I think the vast majority are kind of go along to get along. They let this ideology wash over them. They're more interested in professional advancement. And so they're not super ideological, but they're kind of predisposed to accepting the sort of the dominant ideology of the professional class. I'd say that's probably about 80% of the students. 
> 
> And then I think the other 19% are true believers. And then they go on and staff, they tend to do the professional class jobs that don't pay very well.
> 
> So I think the sort of go along to get along types go work at McKinsey and Goldman Sachs, and the true believers go staff the nonprofits and the activist groups and the Democratic Party and the foundations and, and the media, you know, they go on to, sort of, mainstream media jobs.

Using David Sacks' terminology, there is a minority of _true believers_ in the cultural hegemony, an even smaller minority of overt _rebels_ against the cultural hegemony, and a vast majority of _go-alongs_ who shill for the cultural hegemony so that they can reap the economic benefits of a university degree.

The rebels have already been lost to the cultural hegemony, but there is still a tension in this phenomenon in which the minority true believers must keep the many more go-alongs in line.


## Hegemonic Tactics for Policing the Professional Class

* De-platforming
  * Censorship, e.g., Black at TED's attempt to cancel Coleman Hughes' talk
  * Getting people fired, e.g., "cancellation"
  * Don't hire or promote people with viewpoints that differ from the hegemony -- how graduate school works
  * Create incentives in social structures for people to adopt the hegemony, e.g., "diversity statements"
* Misrepresentation of opposing views -- need concrete examples
* Defamation, e.g., "racist," "sexist," "homophobic," "transphobic"
* Using the false binary to condition the objects of hegemony to uncritically disallow themselves any "right-wing" or "conservative" views, e.g., Melissa Kearney and the _Two-Parent Privilege_


## Cultural Hegemony of Abortion Liberation Ideology

* Explains why even though views on abortion have been near 50/50 split, only one side of this split has been able to completely override 
* My naivete about this explains the bad decisions I made in trying to pursue research career
