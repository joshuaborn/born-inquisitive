## Introduction

The United States of America is a heavily polarized, partisan place. However, as I described in my [review](/myth-of-left-and-right.html) of _The Myth of Left and Right_ by Hyrum and Verlan Lewis [-@lewis_myth_2023], I do not believe the left-right spectrum has any utility as a [description of socio-political viewpoints](when-left-wing-and-right-wing-are-and-arent-substantive-criticism.html) in the United States. Therefore, the left-right spectrum does not explain this partisan polarization.

This raises the question of how to understand the polarization that characterizes American politics. I discovered what I believe to be the best answer to this question a couple of years ago when listening to [episode 40 of season 3 of _Conversations with Coleman_](https://pca.st/1l7zid0r) in which Coleman Hughes interviewed David Sacks.

Coleman Hughes is a columnist, podcaster, and book author who comments on race politics in the United States, and David Sacks is an entrepreneur in the software industry who was the founding CEO of PayPal. However, the explanation of political polarization in the United States ultimately either David Sacks or Coleman Hughes, but from the work of Ruy Teixeira, which they discussed.

Ruy Texeira is a political scientist and co-author of _The Emerging Democratic Majority_ in 2002 and of _Where Have All the Democrats Gone?_ in 2023. The former 2002 book predicted that the Democratic Party would soon have a national voting majority. This did not happen, which led to the latter 2023 book and his ongoing political science work.

The phenomenon that explains polarization in the United States is that of _cultural hegemony._ This cultural hegemony emerges out of the university system in the United States, and is predicated on the institutional dominance of the professional class.


## Voter Polarization between the Professional Class and the Working Class

Ruy Texeira uses the label "professional class" for those in the United States who have a four-year degree from a university and uses the label "working class" for those who do not. By this definition, the United States is a majority working class country, with about two-thirds of the United States working class.

According to the work of Texeira, the biggest polarization in the United States in party preference and in viewpoints on numerous issues occurs between professional class voters and working class voters.

Texeira's explanation for the lack of emergence of a clear national majority voting for Democrats as predicted in his 2002 book is that working class voters are leaving the Democratic Party, despite the Democratic Party being the twentieth century "home" for working class voters.

There are probably many explanations for this phenomenon. For instance, Democrats in the 1990s moved away from New Deal and Great Society economic policies in favor of "neo-liberal" economic policies that favored free trade. A prominent example of this is the public dissatisfaction, especially among working-class voters, with the bipartisan support for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which almost led to third-party candidate Ross Perot being elected president in 1996.

However, one the more enduring reasons Democrats have lost much of the working class vote is that the party caters heavily to the interests, cultural values, and biases of the professional class, either neglecting the viewpoints of the working class or expressing outright contempt toward working class voters. This is an ongoing theme of Texeira's blog [_The Liberal Patriot_](https://substack.com/@theliberalpatriot).


## The University as the Origin of the Cultural Hegemony

The cultural hegemony we experience in the United States has its origin in the university system. American universities are very hierarchical and elitist. There is a glut of individuals who hold PhDs, and very few jobs for them in academia. Graduate students and post-doctoral fellows gravitate to the most highly ranked universities out of necessity in order to advance their careers. Most professors even at more lowly ranked universities come from the most highly ranked universities in some way. Thus, there is a scramble among academics to get names like "Harvard" or "Yale" or "UC Berkeley" on their _curricula vitae._

Therefore, whatever culture is prominent at elite universities trickles down throughout the university system and eventually becomes popular throughout the university system.

Furthermore, almost all the institutional leadership positions in the United States, whether in Fortune 500 companies or government, are occupied by members of the professional class, i.e., by people who have at least four-year university degrees. Thus, almost all positions of leadership in the United States are occupied by people who have been indoctrinated, for four years if not more, in the cultural biases that come down from a select few on high.

This phenomenon is exacerbated by a positive feedback loop created by the job of journalist becoming a professional-class occupation instead of a working-class occupation. Information the public receives via mass media is filtered and framed according to the biases of a culture that ultimately comes from a few prestigious people.


## Cultural Hegemony Explains Polarization in the United States

As David Sacks discussed on his _Conversations with Coleman_ podcast:

> [I]t's all the college graduates who control the institutions because you do need these credentials and degrees. And I think this is fundamentally what is creating all of the sense of stress and fracture in our society -- is that the professional class runs all the institutions, including the colleges, for their benefit and in accordance with their ideology. And it is not the same ideology as the majority of the country. And that sets up a democracy that is unsustainable somehow. And it sets up this -- I think this fundamentally is the battle line of what's going on in our society. 

The most dramatic polarization we see in the United States is between the professional class and the working class, and this is because the professional class has more exposure to the cultural hegemony, while the working class has less exposure to the cultural hegemony. Furthermore, the working class outnumbers the professional class, but the professional class wields more power than the working class, which in a democracy sows discord.

The working class might poll more "conservative" on a social issue, depending on how the pollsters frame the issue and what (ultimately arbitrary) definition of "conservative" is being used. The professional class might poll more "left-wing" than the working class on an issue, based an fleeting and arbitrary characterizations of the left-right spectrum. But all of these labels miss the point that the schism itself is caused by the phenomenon of professional-class cultural hegemony.

If the views of the pseudo-aristocracy that runs the Ivy League and the _New York Times_ were "right-wing" or "conservative," then this schism in American society would still exist, but with a reversing of the labels; there would be a more "right-wing" or "conservative" hegemony compared with a more "left-wing" or "progressive" rest of the country. The source of the polarization itself is the amount of exposure to the cultural hegemony people receive and the amount of power they have in society by virtue of institutional leadership and economic wealth.


## Divisions within the Professional Class

People are motivated to expose themselves to the cultural hegemony because people with four-year university degrees tend to have better economic outcomes than those who do not. As David Sacks discussed:

> And so the fundamental _quid pro quo_ of our civilization is that if you want the economic and social advancement that a college degree brings you, you have to submit to voluntary re-education for four years, maybe longer. And I tend to think that so many of our political divides are essentially downstream of this problem. 

Even though a lot of people are motivated by the socio-economic structures of our society to _expose_ themselves to the cultural hegemony, the degree to which individuals _acquiesce_ to the hegemony varies. Coleman Hughes is an alumnus of Columbia University, and David Sacks is an alumnus of Stanford University, so they both have direct exposure to the cultural hegemony, but they both have rebelled against it in some way. As David Sacks discussed:

> Now, I do think that there are different reactions that people have to this phenomenon. I tend to think there's three types of students or student reactions to this.
> 
> So I tend to think that the first is that you can rebel against it. I tend to think that maybe 1% of the students do this and then -- and those people tend to become either founders, which is why I can stay in business having the views I have, or they tend to become kind of more conservative or independent media personalities.
>
> I think the vast majority are kind of go along to get along. They let this ideology wash over them. They're more interested in professional advancement. And so they're not super ideological, but they're kind of predisposed to accepting the sort of the dominant ideology of the professional class. I'd say that's probably about 80% of the students. 
> 
> And then I think the other 19% are true believers. And then they go on and staff, they tend to do the professional class jobs that don't pay very well.
> 
> So I think the sort of go along to get along types go work at McKinsey and Goldman Sachs, and the true believers go staff the nonprofits and the activist groups and the Democratic Party and the foundations and, and the media -- you know, they go on to, sort of, mainstream media jobs.

Using David Sacks' terminology, there is a minority of _true believers_ in the cultural hegemony, an even smaller minority of overt _rebels_ against the cultural hegemony, and a vast majority of _go-alongs_ who give lukewarm agreement to the cultural hegemony so that they can reap the economic benefits of a university degree.

The rebels have already been lost to the cultural hegemony, but there is still a tension in this phenomenon in which the minority true believers must keep the many more go-alongs in line.


## Hegemonic Tactics for Policing the Professional Class

Because of this tension within the professional class, it is not enough for the true believers in the cultural hegemony to simply rest on their laurels. The hegemony would not be hegemonic if it simply participated in the marketplace of ideas, appealing to each individual's sense of reason in order to persuade someone to agree with the advocated viewpoint among many possible viewpoints. Instead, the cultural hegemony uses tactics to stifle discourse and shut down the marketplace of ideas.


### Deplatforming 

Probably one the most profound methods of the cultural hegemony is the deplatforming of alternative viewpoints. If people dominated by the cultural hegemony are simply not exposed to viewpoints other than those of the cultural hegemony, then they are much less likely to deviate from that orthodoxy.

This can manifest itself in two ways, one more public and one more subtle. The first, more public way is through the efforts to "cancel" public figures who deviate from the orthodoxy of the cultural hegemony. Incidentally, Coleman Hughes, less than a year after this podcast was published, was himself the object of an attempted cancellation.

Like a lot of commentary professionals, Coleman Hughes did a [TED talk](https://colemanhughes.substack.com/p/why-is-ted-scared-of-color-blindness). His talk expressed the opinion that one should not judge others based on their race, either in personal life or public policy. The talk would be singled out by an "employee resource group" entitled "Black\@TED" as upsetting, leading to much back and forth between Hughes and the executives at TED.

TED would go on to release Hughes' talk, but with the condition that Hughes would also have to release another video debating his viewpoint with someone who disagreed with his opinion. [In the end](https://colemanhughes.substack.com/p/my-last-word-on-ted), it appears that TED released, but did not promote Coleman Hughes' talk, leading to far fewer views than a TED talk typically receives.

Numerous articles have discussed this "cancel culture" phenomena, leading to many takes on just how prominent it is in our society. This is beyond the scope of this article. However, I will point out that these cancellations are just one aspect of the much larger phenomenon of cultural hegemony. Indeed, public cancellation is not even the most prolific form of deplatforming done by the cultural hegemony.

The second, more subtle, and much more profound way that deplatforming occurs is in the selection process of admissions, hiring, and promotion. This, like a lot of aspects of the cultural hegemony, has begun in academia.

As Peter Berkowitz, himself a long-time academic, discussed in a [recent talk](https://www.aei.org/events/why-do-american-universities-lean-so-far-to-the-left/), there had been an unwritten rule for decades at many academic departments across the country that the few graduate student spots they had available were reserved for those who subscribed to political ideologies they favor. This could be gleaned from personal statements, interviews, or participation in activist groups on an applicant's _curriculum vitae._ While this likely originated in more socio-politcally oriented fields such as sociology or political science, it has spread even to fields like biology.

What has happened since the rise in prominence of "diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)" initiatives in admissions and hiring, is that these unwritten rules have now become written down and more public. In order to be considered for graduate admissions or hiring, applicants now must submit "diversity statements" that are policed for the "correct" viewpoints.

DEI initiatives can be a way to entrench political biases in hiring and admissions. For instance, someone who advocates "race conscious" public policy that discriminates on race in a "diversity statement" might have their application passed on to the next phase of the review process, whereas if someone like Coleman Hughes were to apply to graduate school and write in his "diversity statement" that he believed we should not discriminate on race in public policy, then his application can be discarded before the next phase of the process. 

Furthermore, DEI initiatives in hiring and admissions are spreading outside of academia into the broader work world. While many who pprove of DEI do so out of honorable motives and a desire for those that face prejudice to be treated fairly, these DEI initiatives give true believers in the cultural hegemony an opportunity to abuse their power to promote those who share their viewpoints and hinder those who differ from their viewpoints from advancing in society.

Regardless if someone thinks that race-neutral or race-discriminatory public policies are the best approach, people like Coleman Hughes should not be excluded from academia or from the discourse at large. Excluding such viewpoints impoverishes the entirety of the discourse, and we are all worse off for this deplatforming.


### Misrepresentation and Defamation



### Fear and Self-Censorship


## The False Binary


## Bullet List

* Hegemonic Tactics
  * Misrepresentation of opposing views -- need concrete examples
  * Defamation, e.g., "racist," "sexist," "homophobic," "transphobic"
  * Fear of being fired
  * Self-censorship
* The False Binary
  * "Left-wing" now means cultural supremacy of the professional class when it once was defined as support for the New Deal, which whether you agree with the policies or not was concerned with working class interests.
  * Using the false binary to condition the objects of hegemony to uncritically disallow themselves any "right-wing" or "conservative" views, e.g., Melissa Kearney and the _Two-Parent Privilege_
    * Anecdotally, woman I once data who was Princeton alumna had this very attitude
* Cultural Hegemony of Abortion Liberation Ideology
  * My naivete about this explains the bad decisions I made in trying to pursue research career
  * Explains how United States is 50/50 on abortion, but academia is more like 99/1 and that 1% is currently being cancelled
  * While views on abortion have been near 50/50 split, only one side of this split has been able to completely override the other in terms of political dominance and in research opportunities
  * When there was less sorting on views on abortion between the two parties, Democrats had to moderate their abortion platform, which means I grew up in an era when the cultural hegemony around abortion was less obvious
