    <p class="heading">About</p>
    <p>
      My name is {{ .Site.Params.Author -}}. I am an amateur social scientist and erstwhile professional statistician.
    </p>
    <p>
      This blog is an outlet for me to explore my own interests in my personal time, including research interests. My studies focus on what I have come to call "reproductive responsibility," which refers to the social science study of pregnancy intent and outcome, contraception, childcare, and parenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike most family planning organizations and academic journals that only platform abortion advocacy, my work is motivated by the judgment that induced abortion of pregnancy as a method of fertility control is morally wrong. Unlike most organizations opposed to induced abortion, my focus is on scholarship and science rather than polemics or religiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am an informer, not an influencer.
