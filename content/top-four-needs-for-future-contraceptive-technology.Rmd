## Introduction

With over 80 million unintended pregnancies and over 40 million induced abortions every year worldwide [@sedgh_intended_2014], it is abundantly clear that the current state of contraception in human civilization is inadequate. 

This should not be surprising because human civilization is still in a very primitive stage of its contraceptive practice. Despite the relative affluence and technological development of the United States, many of the [most popular contraceptive methods in the United States](/use-of-contraception-in-the-united-states-2017-2019.html#methods-used) today -- such as the male condom or the practice of _coitus interruptus_ a.k.a. withdrawal -- are so ancient that their origins are forever lost to history or perhaps prehistory. Indeed, contraception itself in the United States [has only been legal for about a century](/margaret-sanger-on-abortion-in-her-own-words.html#who-was-margaret-sanger).

Furthermore, innovation of contraceptive technology has been mostly stagnant since the development progestin and estrogen based methods, which were originally developed in the 1950s. [@eig_birth_2016] Since then, different modalities for administration of such hormones have been developed in addition to the original oral pill modality, such as injectables, implants, or inclusion in intrauterine devices (IUDs). However, aside from the path of delivery of the hormones and the exact chemical analog of the hormones used, all of these modalities work in basically the same way.

Thus, there has not been a truly new method of contraception developed in approximately 60 years.

It would therefore be tempting to attribute the aforementioned 80 million unintended pregnancies annually to this deficiency of innovation in contraceptive technology. This attribution would likely be accurate, but only partly so. Somewhere between approximately [7.5 to 11.5 million persons in the United States](http://localhost:4321/use-of-contraception-in-the-united-states-2017-2019.html#use-of-contraception-during-most-recent-intercourse) were at risk for unintended pregnancy when they last engaged in sexual intercourse, but did not use _any_ method of contraception whatsoever.[^inconsistently]

[^inconsistently]: These 7.5 to 11.5 million persons include both those who are not using contraception in the long term and those who _are_ using one or more methods, but are [using contraception inconsistently](/use-of-contraception-in-the-united-states-2017-2019.html#consistency-of-use-of-contraception).

Thus, there are both technological and behavioral origins of the annual 80 million unintended pregnancies. Indeed, there is interplay between the technological and behavioral issues such that it is sometimes not clear where one sort of issue ends and the other begins. Despite this overlap, for the sake of brevity this article focuses on the technological issues with the current state of contraception, and discussion of behavioral issues is saved for a subsequent article.


## Long-Acting, Reversible Methods

One area of potential improvement in contraceptive technology is long-acting, reversible contraception (LARC).

The reason for the "long-acting" adjective in LARC is complicated. Two kinds of estimates have been produced for contraceptive failure rates: estimates for "typical use" and estimates for "perfect use," though this naming scheme is somewhat of a misnomer. "Typical use" refers to estimates calculated from surveys of representative samples of large populations. "Perfect use" estimates are ultimately derived from clinical trials of contraceptive methods.

"Perfect use" estimates were created by James Trussell, a professor of population studies at Princeton University. He read more than a hundred and fifty different academic papers that reported on clinical trials of contraceptive methods, decided which were good and which were bad, and did some very back-of-the-envelope math to come up with a "best guess" of a failure rate for each method based on the clinical trials he deemed good. [@trussell_contraceptive_1987; @trussell_contraceptive_2004; @trussell_contraceptive_2011] Estimates of "perfect use" failure rates are thus believed to approximate hypothetical failure rates that could exist, but are never actually observed in the general population and are as much a product of speculation as observation.

Generally, "typical use" failure rates are much higher than "perfect use" failure rates. One hypothesis for this gap is that contraceptive users enrolled in clinical trials from which "perfect use" estimates are derived are better at and more consistent in using contraceptive methods than the general population.

Methods such as condoms require user intervention during every act of intercourse. Birth controls pills require users to take a pill each and every day. If such interventions are not done properly or consistently, the effectiveness of the contraceptive method is greatly decreased. Thus, short-acting contraceptives are very sensitive to user error.

The goal of long-acting contraception is to remove the opportunity for such user error, which would cause "typical use" failure rates to be closer to "perfect use" failure rates, under the hypothesis that user error accounts for some of the gap in failure rates.

Of course, sterilizing operations such as vasectomy or tubal ligation are very long-acting, typically lasting the remainder of a person's reproductive life. They are also orders of magnitude more effective than methods considered reversible.[^considered] However, they are only recommended for those who have reached a point in their lives where they have finished having children. Thus, the reason for the "reversible" adjective in LARC is straightforward: it refers to methods not including sterilizing operations.

[^considered]: The phrase "considered reversible" is used deliberately. Vasectomies, in particular, have been reversed numerous times by vasovasostomy procedures. It is therefore possible to use vasectomy as a kind of LARC, though doing so is "off label."
      
      Sterilizing operations such as vasectomy or tubal ligation are orders of magnitude more effective than contraceptive methods considered reversible. Indeed, while estimating contraceptive failure rates based on the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) is an ongoing project of this blog, survey-based estimates for vasectomy or tubal ligation are oftentimes impossible, because samples for nationally representative surveys are prone to report not a single unintended pregnancy among those using sterilizing operations as a method of contraception. Instead, estimates of failure rates for sterilizing operations must necessarily come from larger samples in prospective studies that follow large numbers of individuals who have undergone vasectomies or tubal ligations.

LARCs are typically interpreted to include methods administered by injection, implant, or insertion of an IUD. If these methods are successfully administered, they may last months or years without any need for additional user intervention.

Not all of the differences between "typical use" and "perfect use" failure rate estimates are due to increased user error in "typical use" contexts. In particular, "typical use" failure rate estimates are biased upwards by contraception overreporting, a phenomenon in which respondents to a survey report using contraception even when they are not.[^underreporting]

[^underreporting]: On the other hand, "typical use" failure rate estimates are biased downwards by induced abortion underreporting. Indeed, only about 38\% of pregnancies ending in induced abortion were reported on the 2017-2019 NSFG. [@national_center_for_health_statistics_2017-2019_2020, Appendix 2: Topic-Specific Notes] Not counting these unreported pregnancies would result in contraceptive failure rates that are lower than the true rates. However, analysis based on the NSFG has attempted to compensate for abortion underreporting since the 1980s. [@grady_contraceptive_1986; @jones_contraceptive_1992]

Indeed, in the 2017-2019 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), respondents representing somewhere between [3 and 5 million](/use-of-contraception-in-the-united-states-2017-2019.html#any-method-during-past-12-months) people who previously indicated they were using contraception in the preceding year, when asked how often they used contraception, replied "none of the time." Thus, it is likely that some of the differences between "typical use" and "perfect use" failure rates are due to measurement error in which respondents are incorrectly counted as using a contraceptive method when they are not.

LARC methods are becoming increasingly popular, and as such users of LARCs will be increasingly sampled in surveys such as the NSFG. One of the more interesting questions to be answered by ongoing work estimating contraceptive failure rates -- including the research work done for this blog -- is whether LARC methods do indeed lead to "typical use" failure rates closer to "perfect use" failure rates than other reversible methods.


## Non-Hormonal Methods

Unfortunately, while LARC might represent an improvement over short-acting contraceptive methods, nearly all LARC methods developed today are hormonal.[^iud] These hormonal methods deliver some combination of progestin and estrogen analogs, which recreate the hormonal conditions signaling a pregnancy and leverage a natural phenomenon in female physiology that suppresses ovulation.

[^iud]: Copper-bearing IUDs not containing a hormonal component would be the major exception. However, copper-bearing IUDs have a [comparable rate of discontinuation](/use-of-contraception-in-the-united-states-2017-2019.html#discontinuation-due-to-dissatisfaction-1) to hormonal IUDs.

The major issue with hormonal methods is that hormones have many non-specific effects, including side effects that can make hormonal contraceptive methods intolerable to many persons. Indeed, somewhere [between 32\% and 37\%](/use-of-contraception-in-the-united-states-2017-2019.html#discontinuation-due-to-dissatisfaction) of women in the United States who have ever tried birth control pills have discontinued use due to dissatisfaction, and side effects are the most common reason for  dissatisfaction, with [between 59\% to 68\%](/use-of-contraception-in-the-united-states-2017-2019.html#pill-1) of those discontinuing birth control pills citing side effects as a reason for dissatisfaction. This represents somewhere between [9.6 and 13.3 million](/use-of-contraception-in-the-united-states-2017-2019.html#reasons-for-discontinuation-of-pill) women in the United States who have quit birth control pills due to side effects.

Side effects are an issue that can occur whenever exogenous hormones are administered. Hormones are signaling molecules that travel throughout a circulatory system, interacting with receptors in distant organs, which may themselves increase or decrease hormone production in response, which in turn can cause yet another organ to change its hormone output. Thus, hormones by their very nature lead to broad and unpredictable effects.

A hormonal method that causes side effects discourages persons from using that specific method. Such experience may discourage persons from using contraception more generally. This is one area, alluded to in the introduction, in which shortcomings of contraceptive technology and shortcomings of contraceptive behavior interact.

In contrast, non-hormonal methods such as male condoms (6.8\%~9.9\%), withdrawal (5.3\%~8.3\%), and calendar methods (4.1\%~8.2\%) have [much lower rates](/use-of-contraception-in-the-united-states-2017-2019.html#discontinuation-due-to-dissatisfaction) of discontinuation due to dissatisfaction. Unfortunately, they have much lower rates of effectiveness, as well, and none of the reversible, non-hormonal methods with low discontinuation rate are long-acting.[^iud2]

[^iud2]: See above note about copper-bearing IUDs.

The innovation that has been hormonal contraception should not be ignored. If hormonal contraception were never developed, the _only_ contraceptive methods available today would be the ancient, less-effective methods. However, hormonal contraception has only been an improvement in contraceptive practice among those who can find a formulation of hormones that their bodies can tolerate. Hormonal contraception can thus be viewed as just the _beginning_ of modern contraception in which easily reached, low hanging fruit was grasped before moving on to fruits both better and more difficult to reach.

Currently, there are some less effective methods that have low discontinuation rates, and there are some more effective methods that have high discontinuation rates. Therefore, a novel method that is both highly effective and less prone to side effects has great potential to improve contraceptive practice. Due to the nature of hormones, such a method would most likely be non-hormonal.
