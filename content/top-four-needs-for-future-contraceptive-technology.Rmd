## Introduction

With over 80 million unintended pregnancies and over 40 million induced abortions every year worldwide [@sedgh_intended_2014], it is abundantly clear that the current state of contraception in human civilization is inadequate. 

This should not be surprising because human civilization is still in a very primitive stage of contraceptive practice. Despite the relative affluence and technological development of the United States, many of the [most popular contraceptive methods in the United States](/use-of-contraception-in-the-united-states-2017-2019.html#methods-used) today -- such as the male condom and the practice of _coitus interruptus_ a.k.a. withdrawal -- are so ancient that their origins are forever lost to history or perhaps prehistory. Indeed, contraception itself in the United States [has only been legal for about a century](/margaret-sanger-on-abortion-in-her-own-words.html#who-was-margaret-sanger).

Furthermore, development of contraceptive technology has been mostly stagnant since the development of a female-specific hormonal method based on doses of progestin and estrogen, which was originally developed in the 1950s. [@eig_birth_2016] Since then, different modalities for administration of such hormones have been developed in addition to the original oral pill modality, such as injectables, implants, or inclusion in intrauterine devices (IUDs). However, aside from the path for delivery of the hormones and the exact chemical analog of the hormones used, all of these modalities work in basically the same way.

Thus, there has not been a truly new method of contraception developed in approximately 60 years.

It would therefore be tempting to attribute the aforementioned 80 million unintended pregnancies annually to this deficiency of progress in contraceptive technology. This attribution would likely be accurate, but only partly so. Somewhere between approximately [7.5 to 11.5 million persons in the United States](http://localhost:4321/use-of-contraception-in-the-united-states-2017-2019.html#use-of-contraception-during-most-recent-intercourse) were at risk for unintended pregnancy when they engaged in sexual intercourse most recently, but did not use _any_ method of contraception whatsoever. These 7.5 to 11.5 million persons include both those who are not using contraception in the long term and those who _are_ using one or more methods, but are [using contraception inconsistently](/use-of-contraception-in-the-united-states-2017-2019.html#consistency-of-use-of-contraception).

Thus, there are both technological and behavioral origins of the annual 80 million unintended pregnancies. Indeed, there is interplay between the technological and behavioral issues such that it is sometimes not clear where one sort of issue ends and another begins. This is further complicated by the fact that human civilization sometimes solves what appear to be its behavioral problems with technological solutions.

Despite this overlap, for the sake of brevity this article focuses on the technological issues with the current state of contraception, and discussion of behavioral issues is saved for a subsequent article.


## Long-Acting, Reversible Methods

A trending topic in the birth control literature is long-acting, reversible contraception (LARC).

The reason for the "reversible" adjective in LARC is straightforward: sterilizing operations such as vasectomy or tubal ligation are orders of magnitude more effective than contraceptive methods considered reversible.[^considered] Indeed, while estimating contraceptive failure rates based on the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) is an ongoing project of this blog, survey-based estimates for vasectomy or tubal ligation are oftentimes impossible, because samples for nationally representative surveys are prone to report not a single unintended pregnancy among those using sterilizing operations as a method of contraception.[^prospective] Thus, the inclusion of "reversible" in LARC reflects an aspiration for methods considered reversible to perform as well as sterilizing operations.

[^considered]: The phrase "considered reversible" is used deliberately. Vasectomies, in particular, have in point of fact been reversed numerous times by vasovasostomy procedures.

[^prospective]: Instead, estimates of failure rates for sterilizing operations must necessarily come from larger samples in prospective studies that follow large numbers of individuals who have undergone vasectomies or tubal ligations.

The reason for the "long-acting" adjective in LARC is more complicated. Two kinds of estimates have been produced for contraceptive failure rates: estimates for "typical use" and estimates for "perfect use," though this naming scheme is somewhat of a misnomer.

"Typical use" refers to estimates calculated from surveys of representative samples of populations. "Perfect use" estimates came from James Trussell -- who is now professor _emeritus_ and will presumably no longer be generating the estimates -- reading more than a hundred and fifty different academic papers that report on clinical trials of contraceptive methods, deciding which were good and which were bad, and doing some very back-of-the-envelope math to come up with a "best guess" of a failure rate for each method based on the clinical trials he deemed good. [@trussell_contraceptive_1987; @trussell_contraceptive_2004; @trussell_contraceptive_2011]

Estimates of "perfect use" failure rates are thus believed to approximate a hypothetical failure rate that could exist, but is never actually observed in the general population. Estimates of "typical use" failure rates are estimates based on actual observations of large populations, but are host to a myriad of other issues of their own.

In particular, "typical use" failure rate estimates are biased upwards by contraception overreporting, a phenomenon in which respondents to a survey report using contraception even when they are not. Indeed, in the 2017-2019 NSFG, respondents representing somewhere between [3 and 5 million](/use-of-contraception-in-the-united-states-2017-2019.html#any-method-during-past-12-months) people who previously indicated using contraception at some point in the preceding year, when asked how often they used contraception, replied "none of the time."

On the other hand, "typical use" failure rate estimates are biased downwards by induced abortion underreporting. Indeed, only about 38\% of pregnancies ending in induced abortion were reported on the 2017-2019 NSFG. [@national_center_for_health_statistics_2017-2019_2020, Appendix 2: Topic-Specific Notes] Not counting these unreported pregnancies would result in contraceptive failure rates that are lower than the true rates.

While these two phenomenon are contrary, they do not cancel each other out. Analysis based on the NSFG has attempted to compensate for abortion underreporting since the 1980s [@grady_contraceptive_1986; @jones_contraceptive_1992], but these corrections at best remove only some of one of the two biases. Thus, "typical use" estimates are biased, and it is not known to what degree.

What can be known is that "typical use" failure rates, which come from representative surveys, are far greater than "perfect use" failure rates, which come ultimately from clinical trials.

One hypothesis for this gap is that contraceptive users enrolled in clinical trials are scrutinized before admission to the trial and more closely supervised in their contraceptive use, resulting in subpopulations of people who use contraception better than the general population.

Methods such as condoms require proper user intervention during every act of intercourse. A method administered by way of oral pills require users to take a pill each and every day. If such actions are not taken consistently, the effectiveness of the contraceptive method is greatly decreased. Short-term contraceptives are thus very sensitive to user error.

The goal of long-acting contraception is to remove the opportunity for user error, causing "typical use" failure rates to be closer to "perfect use" failure rates. LARCs are typically interpreted to include methods administered by injection, implant, or insertion of an IUD. If these methods are successfully administered, they may last months or years without any need for user intervention.

LARC methods are becoming increasingly popular in recent years, and as such users of LARCs will be increasingly sampled in surveys such as the NSFG. One of the more interesting questions to be answered by ongoing work estimating contraceptive failure rates -- including the research work done for this blog -- is whether LARC methods do indeed live up to the promise and result in "typical use" failure rates closer to "perfect use" failure rates than other reversible methods.
