## Introduction

If enough time is spent around those that construe themselves as doing scientific inquiry, one is liable to encounter the maxim "anecdotes are not evidence." Anecdotes are stories that consist either of one's own personal experiences or the retelling of the personal experiences of others. The maxim "anecdotes are not evidence" is a healthy reminder that the use of anecdotes as evidence has numerous flaws.

However, the maxim "anecdotes are not evidence," like all slogans, is a short, catchy phrase and is devoid of any substantially informative content. While such a catch phrase can be used as a mnemonic device to recall deeper understanding, it can also be used without any cognizance of the issues to which it alludes. When used in this latter way, the maxim can be interpreted in ways that lead to implications that are false.

One such false implication that stems from an extremely literal interpretation of the maxim "anecdotes are not evidence" is that _nothing at all_ can be learned from anecdotes.

Such a literal interpretation can be used to undermine the maxim itself. For instance, one could note a case in which a serial sex offender was caught due to the testimony of victims, which is necessarily anecdotal, and conclude that those who subscribe to "anecdotes are not evidence" would throw out this testimony, setting the sex offender free. This is such a morally repugnant proposition for so many that it could be used as a way to discredit those who are fond of the maxim "anecdotes are not evidence."

This literal interpretation can also be used as a foolish obstacle to understanding. For instance, if one hears stories from friends that a certain road is congested with traffic during rush hour, one might dismiss these stories, citing "anecdotes are not evidence." One would have no one to blame but oneself when one finds oneself stuck in traffic on the very same road, waiting for the rush hour congestion to clear.

Surely, because of these implications, this overly literal interpretation does not capture what the maxim "anecdotes are not evidence" is meant to convey. This is a flaw not just with this particular maxim, but with slogans in general, which threaten to become [shibboleths](political-rhetoric-as-shibboleths.html) when used incognizantly in this way.

The purpose of this article is to articulate the issues in using anecdotes as evidence in a more substantial way than can be done with a pithy maxim. It begins by discussing the sort of inference for which anecdotes are entirely useless, and this is balanced with later discussion of valid uses of anecdotes.


## Misuses of Anecdotes

Anecdotal evidence is useless for two kinds of inference: inference about a larger population and inference about cause and effect. 

### Inference about a Larger Population
 
While the prevalence or magnitude of a variable among some number of individuals that can be directly observed might sometimes be of interest, interesting questions oftentimes pertain to a larger population than those that are directly observed. For instance, an epidemiologist is usually professionally interested in how many people contracted the seasonal flu in a given geographic area, not how many of the epidemiologist's friends contracted the seasonal flu. This is a question about a larger population, i.e., all the people in the given geographic area, that is based on a smaller, representative sample, e.g., surveys, hospital records, etc. Anecdotes shed no light on these kinds of questions.

### Inference about Cause and Effect

Practical questions often pertain to whether or not something causes an effect. For instance, in clinical trials, a potential therapy is given to volunteers in order to determine whether or not the therapy causes an improvement in a disease or an increase in survival time. It is not enough to know how many people receiving the treatment improve or to what extent they improve. Indeed, there are many diseases from which people will often recover of their own accord. Rather, the question that is at issue in a clinical trial is whether or not the potential therapy _caused_ any measured improvement. Again, anecdotes are no help in answering this kind of question.


## Flaws of Anecdotes as Evidence

Flaws in using anecdotes as a kind of evidence can broadly be grouped into two categories: statistical and psychological. The statistical flaws are what specifically preclude anecdotes from being useful for inference about a larger population and for inference about cause and effect, but do not prevent anecdotes from being useful in other ways. The psychological flaws affect anecdotal evidence no matter what the use, and so these flaws must be acknowledged and accepted during the valid uses of anecdotes articulated later.

### Statistical Flaws

#### Insufficient Sample Size

Returning to the example of the seasonal flu, suppose one is interested in how effective this year's flu vaccine was in preventing individuals from contracting the flu in the United States during the 2019-2020 flu season. Perhaps there are 9 friends and family that one keeps in touch with regularly. Of these 9, 6 were vaccinated against the flu, and 1 caught the flu this year. The 1 who caught the flu was not vaccinated. What estimate should one make of how effective this year's vaccine was?

One might be tempted to say that, given these observations, this year's flu vaccine was absolutely effective. None of one's friends and family that were vaccinated caught the flu this year. However, this is mistaken. Flu vaccines are effective at decreasing the risk that a vaccinated individual has in catching the flu, but they do not decrease the risk to zero. 

The issue this example highlights is that anecdotal evidence rarely consists of enough observations to make an inference to a larger population or to make an inference about cause and effect. Given a sample size of only 9, it is more likely than not that there would _not be a single individual_ in the sample who both was vaccinated and who caught the flu.[^envelope] However, in a larger sample of, for instance, 1,000 individuals, there would be many individuals who were vaccinated and who caught the flu.[^envelope-estimate]

[^envelope]: This is based on some back-of-the-envelope math. The U. S. Census Bureau estimated population of the United States to be approximately 328,000,000 people. The proportion of people in the United States who received the flu vaccine during the 2019-2020 season is estimated to be 63.8% for all age groups. Therefore, there were approximately 209,300,000 vaccinated individuals and 118,700,000 unvaccinated individuals.

     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there were 39,000,000 - 56,000,000 flu illnesses in the United States during the 2019-2020 flu season, which can be taken as a point estimate of 47,500,000. A rough estimate of the relative risk for flu vaccination of 50% is reasonable.

     This results in estimated probabilities of 21.3% of catching the flu among the unvaccinated and 10.6% of catching the flu among the vaccinated.

     The probability a randomly selected individual both was vaccinated and caught the flu is therefore 63.8% &times; 10.6% &approx; 6.76%, and the probability a random sample of 9 individuals does not contain someone who both was vaccinated and caught the flu is (1 &minus; 6.76%)<sup>9</sup> &approx; 53.3%. 

[^envelope-estimate]: Using the back-of-the-envelope calculations above, there would be around 68 such individuals in a random sample of 1,000.

These anecdotes do not consist of a large enough number of observations to calculate even a crude estimate of vaccine efficacy in this case. This is often the case that anecdotal evidence constitutes a sample of insufficient size.

#### Unrepresentative Samples

### Psychological Flaws

Contrary to popular belief, human memory does not work like a video camera, accurately recording the events we see and hear so that we can review and inspect them later, as 63% of respondents in a demographically representative sample of 1,500 people in the United States believed in a recent telephone poll. [@simons_what_2011] Instead, human memory is flawed. People often fail to remember true things about past experiences or believe they remember false things about past experiences. Furthermore, the social experience of recalling memories and sharing them with others can influence how individuals remember past events.

#### Flaws of Memory Recall

The psychological literature around the topic of memory is quite large, and a full review of what has been learned about the fallibility of memory recall is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, this article summarizes a few seminal experiments in the field in order to establish the core point that memory, according to the empirical evidence, is quite fallible.
