Political rhetoric comprises some of the worst excuses for dialogue known to human civilization. In this article, the concept of a shibboleth, which comes from an example of sectarian conflict in the Hebrew Bible, is used to explain a function of slogans in the context of political rhetoric, and the characteristics of such shibboleths that make them inimical to my worldview are examined.

## Introduction

Inasmuch as a conversation consists of two or more individuals engaged in at least two activities -- communicating their own thoughts and understanding the other party’s thoughts -- political rhetoric often fails to merit being labeled a "conversation." It can fail to be a conversation in the sense of the latter activity when one has no genuine interest in even attempting to understand what the other party is communicating.

However, this article examines a different, but also common, failure in the sense of the former activity: political rhetoric often fails to communicate any tangible thoughts because it consists of slogans, catch-phrases, or more generally, superficial ideas commonly passed around by a faction amongst themselves.

It is naive to believe that the purpose of all usage of language is to communicate information, and I do not believe such is the purpose of the sort of political rhetoric identified here. Therefore, I do not believe one can be enlightened _by_ political rhetoric. However, one can be enlightened in how one thinks _about_ political rhetoric.


## Definition of "Shibboleth"

The word "shibboleth" comes to the English language from the Hebrew Bible. In the below passage, a civil war is described between tribes of Israel. The Ephraimites have invaded the territory of the Gileadites, who are led by Jephthah. 

> Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they said, "You are fugitives from Ephraim, you Gileadites—--in the heart of Ephraim and Manasseh."^[This passage can be difficult to read because there are two different usages of what is rendered in the English as "fugitives." In this instance, the Ephraimites are calling the Gileadites "fugitives from Ephraim." Ephraim and Manasseh were named after two sons of Joseph and are considered to be two subtribes of the tribe of Joseph. The tribe of Gilead is sometimes itself considered to be a subtribe of the tribe of Manasseh.] Then the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. Whenever one of the fugitives of Ephraim^[In this case, the passage is using "fugitives of Ephraim" to describe the Ephraimites fleeing their defeat. It is not referring to the Gileadites as in the earlier "fugitives from Ephraim" passage.] said, "Let me go over," the men of Gilead would say to him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" When he said, "No," they said to him, "Then say Shibboleth," and he said, "Sibboleth," for he could not pronounce it right. Then they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. Forty-two thousand of the Ephraimites fell at that time. [@coogan_new_2010, Judges 12:4-6 NRSV]

According to the passage, the Ephraimites had been defeated by the Gileadites. Not wanting to spare any Ephraimites, the Gileadites blockaded the River Jordan so that no Ephraimites could escape the massacre.

This led to a problem for the Gileadites blockading the river. How would a Gileadite know if any given person caught crossing the River Jordan were a fleeing Ephraimite or just a Gileadite going about one's business? The solution related by the passage is that the Gileadites blockading the river challenged the river crossers to say a specific word, which was pronounced one way in the Gileadite dialect and another way in the Ephraimite dialect. If one pronounced it the Gileadite way, one would be spared, but if one pronounced it the Ephraimite way, one would be killed.

What was important was not what the word _"shibboleth"_ meant.^[Incidentally, there is some debate amongst modern scholarship as to what the word did mean.] Indeed, any ancient Hebrew word with a leading _"sh"_ sound might have served the same function. What was important was that the pronunciation of the word could be used as a marker to differentiate members of one tribe from another.

As the concept of shibboleth has evolved in modern English, it has grown beyond just the use of the _pronunciation_ of a word as a tribal marker, encompassing definitions such as:

> a word or saying used by adherents of a party, sect, or belief and usually regarded by others as empty of real meaning [@merriam-webster_shibboleth_nodate]

This broadened concept of the shibboleth to include sayings denotes precisely the kind of political rhetoric that is the subject of this article.


## Characteristics of Shibboleths

Much as the ancient _"shibboleth"_ was a word used to identify to what tribe an individual belonged, the modern shibolleths of political rhetoric are slogans used to identify to what political tribe an individual belongs. For instance, in the United States, there are certain slogans that one can use to be associated with the conservative tribe, and there are other slogans that one can use to be associated with the leftist tribe.

Much as the ancient _"shibboleth"_ was used in a tribal conflict to identify enemies, so too do modern political factions use shibboleths to identify their enemies. This can occur either directly, in which conservatives notice leftists use certain slogans or leftists notice conservatives use certain slogans, or indirectly by construing a sin of omission, in which members of a political tribe proclaim their shibboleths and react with hostility to anyone who does not echo back a similar shibboleth. This latter use of shibboleths is of the "anyone who is not with us is against us" variety.


### Conformity

Thus, one of the most conspicuous characteristics of shibboleths is that they are expressions of conformity.

![
_A sign consisting of nothing but left-wing shibboleths, found in front of a house in the author's neighborhood._^[A right-wing version of such a sign would have been included in this article, but the author does not live in a area where these are easily found.]
](/images/shibboleths.jpg)

For instance, consider the above sign. The sign contains eight shibboleths. All of these shibboleths demonstrate affiliation with the leftist political tribe. Is it the case that the individual who posted this sign just happened to come to the left-wing position on all eight issues, and the individual found someone else who was making signs who also just happened to come to the left-wing position on all eight issues?

It is far more likely the case that, because an individual's moral sentiments are influenced by the individual's social milieu, that both the sign buyer and the sign maker are influenced by the same social forces. Much as the ancient Ephriamites' similar pronounciation of  _"shibboleth"_ was due to a common origin, shibboleths today are expressions of conformity to the same political tribe.


### Exclusion of Viewpoints Other than a Binary Rivalary

If it is assumed that each of these eight shibboleths allude to a logically independent issue, and that there are at least two possible opinions one might have about each issue, then there are 2<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;256 possible viewpoints that any one person could have about these eight issues.^[Here, by "viewpoint" is meant a unique combination opinions on each of the eight issues.] This is actually a minimum bound and likely an underestimate, as there are far more than two possible opinions that any one person could reasonable have about an issue, so there are likely on the order of magnitude of 5<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;390625 such viewpoints, if not more.

However, note that each of these left-wing shibboleths targets a right-wing policy position, or perhaps more accurately, a straw-man version of a right-wing position. Thus, the use of shibboleths reinforces the dominance of dialogue by two viewpoints to the exclusion of all others.

Leftists, conservative, and occasionally libertarian positions already crowd out the hundreds if not hundreds of thousands of other viewpoints in the United States. Much as the ancient use of _"shibboleth"_ assumed all who attempted to cross the River Jordan were either Gileadite or Ephramite, the use of shibboleths today reinforces the exclusion of all but a few viewpoints.


### Superficiality
