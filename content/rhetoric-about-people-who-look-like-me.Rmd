The culture of what has been called "identity politics" has become salient in the United States. On several occasions I have encountered writings decrying those who do not understand what it is like to grow up not seeing people who "look like you" in the popular media. It seems to have become routine for entertainers who win awards and who are not categorized as "White" to proclaim how they have paved the way and inspired young people who "look like me."

I will rapidly move past my annoyance at entertainers' self-aggrandizing attitudes and exaggerated views of the importance of entertainers to human civilization. However, I will allow myself to ruminate on a much more profound sense of annoyance I feel whenever I encounter these statements. 

I am someone who is categorized as "interracial" by the rest of United States society. This is not a unique experience to me, and I do not view this categorization as a part of my core identity. If I were asked to summarize the attributes I find to be most important for someone to understand who I am, being categorized as "interracial" would likely not even make the top ten. However, my "interracial" status is important for understanding my disgust at the "people who look like me" rhetoric. 

I grew up without people who look like me in the popular media. Any experience that race-identifiers -- i.e., those who happily categorize themselves as "White," "Black," "Hispanic," "Asian," "Indigenous," etc. -- might have had leading them to complain about lack of "representation" in popular culture, I experienced even more so.

My experience lacking this kind of representation was multiplied by the fact that people categorized as "interracial" make up even less of the cast of popular culture than race-identifiers, and those categorized with the same specific combination of racial categories in which I am also categorized make up even less of the cast of popular culture.

Throughout my life, I have struggled for representation, and I have searched in vain for what might be termed "my people." However, I could not care less that I did not grow up seeing people who look like me on television.

I have struggled to be represented for my ideas, my values, my truth-seeking, my nuanced thoughtfulness, and my ability to discern and deliver knowledge to the rest of humanity. My people are not (necessarily) those who look like me, but those who share my values and my philosophical outlook. My people are those who could be my colleagues, rather than my doppelgangers.

I would even welcome a base level of representation in which others stop misrepresenting my views. This would require the stupidity that is political partisanship to be attenuated enough for a more intelligent public discourse to emerge. That is a world so far removed from the one in which I live that it seems like a fantasy to write about it in so many words, so I calibrate my expectations to live with the reality of a public discourse composed primarily of blind partisan hatred and demagoguery. 

Of course, my failure to achieve my kind of representation is not just the fault of the society in which I live, but my fault as well...

If it appears as though I am judging the other "look like me" version of "representation" as superficial, that is because I am. However, this is a value judgement...

This is not to understate the importance of culture... There is, at least, something very honest about "look like me" rhetoric...

I have been in my personal experience, like Kwame Anthony Appiah, a kind of human Rorschach test...
