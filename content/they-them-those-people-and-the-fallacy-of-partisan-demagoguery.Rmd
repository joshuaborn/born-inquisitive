## Introduction

I have written about [fallacies](/tags/fallacies.html) in social criticism that I have largely overcome. For instance, once I became aware of the practice of [listing confirmatory examples](/selection-bias-and-the-fallacy-of-listing-examples.html) of some phenomenon and how this proves nothing about the prevalence of the phenomenon, I have largely stopped doing it. Similarly, [generic thinking](/fallacy-of-generic-thinking.html) is something that I used to consciously do, but once I read about it and reflected upon it, I have mostly purged it from my thinking -- with one major exception. The exception is the description of an out-group "other," which is the topic of this article. I write this article in the first-person because even though I am aware of the fallacy I am describing, I still -- much to my chagrin -- catch myself doing it all of the time.

In the United States, conservatives spend a lot of time and energy talking about leftists,[^leftist] and leftists spend a lot of time and energy talking about conservatives. Unsurprisingly, most of this time and energy is spent describing the other group as bad. A similar sort of phenomenon can be seen in various times and places across the Earth whenever there is an opportunity for binary sorting into an "us" and a "them." This is the most obvious context in which the fallacy discussed in this article occurs.

[^leftist]: The use of the word "liberal" is avoided in this article because the term "liberal" is heavily confounded. While it is often used to refer to leftist politics in the United States, "liberal" parties in many other countries are right-wing or center-right parties. Furthermore, even in the United States, "neo-liberal" economic policies and "classical liberal" political philosophies are often associated with right-wing or libertarian positions.

However, mine is a strange case in that I have become quite habituated to being a perpetual "other." I find myself not at home with conservatives, nor with leftists. I am equally alien among libertarians. While moral compunction about induced abortion of pregnancy as a method of fertility control has motivated my desire to work on contraception, this has left me feeling even less represented. Every now and again I search for organizations that might represent my values or my approach to reproductive responsibility, and fail to find any.[^closest]

[^closest]: The closest I have found are small, niche organizations such as [Secular Pro-Life](https://secularprolife.org/) or [Pro-Life Humanists](https://www.prolifehumanists.org/). The former consists of three women who blog, make speeches, and go to rallies; the latter consists of one woman who engages in similar activities. While my worldview has a lot of overlap with the worldviews of these individuals, they focus far more on politics and [moral arguments](/moral-skepticism.html) than I care to, and as the preceding description alludes to, these organizations are so small they present little opportunity for networking to find others doing social science research.

Sure, there are those organizations opposed to abortion as a method of fertility control, but when they frame themselves in religions terms or focus on politics, they do not represent what I do. On the other hand, there are organizations which study contraception, but all of those I have encountered are avowedly in favor of abortion as method of fertility control.[^guttmacher] Thus, while I occasionally write about the [early birth control movement](/margaret-sanger-on-abortion-in-her-own-words.html) and yearn for such a community today, I mostly just do my own thing by myself.

[^guttmacher]: To be fair, this basically just the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which is the only organization I have encountered that does substantial social science research on contraception.

In short, I do not feel like I have an "us." I therefore find it even more perplexing that I still find myself committing the fallacy of characterizing what "they" do that bothers me, what I think of "them," or my differences with "those people."

Upon reflection, I have realized that these kind of thoughts are worthless and should be purged from my thinking. Instead, I should stay centered on my own activities and being productive with them, and consider the thoughts of the specific other individuals I actually encounter in my life, rather than populate my mind with the fallacies I describe in the sequel.

By extension, it is also prudent for me not to waste my time engaging with those occupied with the act of characterizing "them" -- e.g., conservatives complaining about the "liberals" again or a leftist complaining about conservatives for the five thousandth time.

A good way to construe my realization is that, going forward, sentiments about "they," "them," or "those people" constitute signals to me. Whenever I encounter such signals, whether in my own thinking or the thinking of someone else, I stop to scrutinize whether the fallacies I describe in the sequel are being committed. If so, I excise the sentiments as worthless. If I have discovered them in my own thinking, I stop that line of thought. If I have discovered them in the thinking of someone else, I stop giving such sentiments further consideration.
