## Introduction

Different people have radically different judgments about the practice of killing human fetuses or embryos as a method of fertility control, which is euphemistically described in the medical literature as "induced abortion of pregnancy" and in the vernacular as just "abortion." For instance,

Among those who approve of this practice, how the approval is framed varies considerably by social context. In the United States, those who judge killing fetuses and embryos for fertility control as a moral good typically subscribe to some version of abortion-as-women's-liberation ideology, which is unsurprising given the prominence of "freedom" in the political mythology of the United States. However, in China, approval of abortion for fertility control is more likely to be construed as part of the duty of a family to act for the greater benefit of society at large, rather than individual freedom. [@nie_behind_2005]

Regardless of particular social context and ideology for the approval, this article contends that approval of abortion as a method of fertility control is, in the grand scheme of things, a conservative position. This conservatism has important ramifications for those of us who do have moral compunction about the practice.


## Definition of "Conservative" Used

First of all, it should be noted that by "conservative" is not meant the definition of "conservative" used to refer to right-wing politics in contrast to left-wing politics, such as "of or constituting a political party professing the principles of conservatism." [-@noauthor_conservative_nodate, 1b] Rather, by "conservative" is meant such definitions as "tending or disposed to maintain existing views, conditions, or institutions." [@noauthor_conservative_nodate, 2a] Approval of abortion is conservative because it is the preservation of the _status quo._


## _Status Quo_ of Abortion

Induced abortion of pregnancy as a method of fertility control is both very ancient and very common.


### Very Ancient

The ancient Greek physician Hippocrates who lived during the classical period (5th to 4th centuries B.C.E.) wrote of a story in his treatise _On the Nature of the Child:_

> A female relative of mine once owned a very valuable singing girl who had relations with men, but who was not to become pregnant lest she lose her value. The singing girl had heard what women say to one another, that when a woman is about to conceive, the seed does not run out of her, but remains inside. She understood what she heard and always paid attention, and when she one time noticed that the seed did not run out of her, she told her mistress, and the case came to me. When I heard (sc. what had happened), I told her to spring up and down so as to kick her heels against her buttocks, and when she had sprung for the seventh time, the seed ran out on to the ground with a noise, and the girl on seeing it gazed at it and was amazed.
>
> How it looked I will recount: it was as if someone had removed the external shell of a raw egg, and the fluid part inside was visible through the internal membrane. Its appearance was somewhat as follows, to say as much as is needed: it was red and roundish; broad, white strands were seen to be present inside the membrane, pressed together with thick, red serum, and around the membrane on the outside there was bloody material. Through the middle of the membrane something narrow came out, which appeared to me to be an umbilical cord, and through this the movement of breath in and out first took place. From this the membrane spread out and completely enclosed the seed. [@hippocrates_nature_2012, 36-37]

The casual way in which Hippocrates relates the killing of a human embryo in order to preserve the value of a slave is indicative of how little compunction he felt at induced abortion for the most pecuniary of motives. It also shows that knowledge of how to induce abortion was being promulgated as early as the Greek classical period.

Induced abortion was common knowledge throughout the Greco-Roman era. The seminal _De materia medica_ of 1st century C.E. pharmacologist-botanist Dioscorides, which was widely read for more than a millennium, notes 66 substances that can be used as an abortifacient.[^list] [@dioscorides_materia_2000] Soranus, writing in either the 1st or 2nd century C.E., describes procedures for inducing abortion in his _Gynecology,_ including some procedures that use substances described by Dioscorides. [@soranus_gynecology_1991, 66-68] Given its prevalence in widely promulgated texts of the Greco-Roman era, knowledge of how to induce abortion of pregnancy was relatively accessible.

It is clear that the ancients knew of ways to kill embryos and fetuses _in utero._ Gleaning what were the attitudes toward abortion, however, is more complicated, since there were no nationally representative opinion polls in antiquity.

It is clear that at least one famous figure, the philosopher Aristotle, endorsed abortion specifically _as a method of fertility control._ Writing in the 4th century B.C.E., he recommends in his _Politics:_

> As regards whether to expose or nourish what is born, let the law be to nourish nothing that is defective but not to expose anything born, where the arrangement of customs forbids [more than a certain number of children], merely because of numbers. For there should be a limit to the amount of child-getting, but if some couple together and get offspring contrary to this, abortion should be procured before perception and life appear (what is and is not holy will be defined by perception and life). [@simpson_politics_1997, 1335b19]

While Aristotle specifically endorses induced abortion of pregnancy as a method of fertility control, this is only when abortion is induced before "perception and life" appear, a persistent theme throughout his writings.

* Cite other references to threshold attitude of Aristotle

This an early example of what might be called "threshold" attitudes toward abortion as fertility control, which posit that killing fetuses or embryos as a method family planning is acceptable before a certain point in their development, but killing them after this threshold is unacceptable. Such threshold attitudes would include those that posit an inflection point such as "personhood," "viability," "sentience," etc., occurring _in utero._

Description of Aristotle's views on abortion as a method of fertility control is not to deny that there were a diversity of moral viewpoints on abortion in antiquity, much as the morality of abortion is a controversial subject in modern times. However, interpretation of ancient Greco-Roman attitudes toward induced abortion by modern sensibilities is made more complicated by the fact that infanticide and child abandonment as a method of fertility control were not just common, but considered the legal right of male heads of households in ancient times.

* More discussion of _patria potestas_

Thus, proposing that children should be protected from being killed arbitrarily according to the wishes of their _pater familias_ would have been considered a strange and foreign position in antiquity.[^extreme] When the morality of induced abortion of pregnancy was debated in antiquity, it was typically not debated with regards to the morality of killing unwanted children, which was assumed to be acceptable, but with regard to other considerations. For instance, Soranus relates how there was much disagreement about induced abortion in his day:

[^extreme]: Such positions might even have been considered "extremist" for their day.

> A contraceptive differs from an abortive, for the first does not let conception take place, while the latter destroys what has been conceived. Let us, therefore, call the one "abortive" _(phthorion)_ and the other "contraceptive" _(atokion)._ And an "expulsive" _(ekbolion)_ some people say is synonymous with an abortive; others, however, say that there is a difference because an expulsive does not mean drugs but shaking and leaping, .... For this reason they say that Hippocrates, although prohibiting abortives, yet in his book "On the Nature of the Child" employs leaping with the heels to the buttocks for the sake of expulsion.
> 
> But a controversy has arisen. For one party banishes abortives, citing the testimony of Hippocrates who says: "I will give to no one an abortive"; moreover, because it is the specific task of medicine to guard and preserve what has been engendered by nature. The other party prescribes abortives, but with discrimination, that is, they do not prescribe them when a person wishes to destroy the embryo because of adultery or out of consideration for youthful beauty; but only to prevent subsequent danger in parturition if the uterus is small and not capable of accommodating the complete development, or if the uterus at its orifice has knobby swellings and fissures, or if some similar difficulty is involved. And they say the same about contraceptives as well, and we too agree with them. And since it is safer to prevent conception from taking place than to destroy the fetus, we shall now first discourse upon such prevention. [@soranus_gynecology_1991, 62-63]

Soranus relates a lot of information here about disagreement over the morality of killing embryos or fetuses, but this passage is notable because there is no consideration as to whether it is morally wrong to kill embryos or fetuses like it is morally wrong to kill a young child. This is likely absent because the idea that it was morally wrong to kill a young child was not yet widely accepted. Thus, because of the widespread practice of infanticide and child abandonment, the ancients lacked a comparison for moral compunction about the killing of embryos and fetuses _per se._

Soranus might appear to describe an attitude of using induced abortion only to protect the life of the mother when he describes those who prescribe abortives "with discrimination." However, he immediately judges this attitude about abortion to be similar to attitudes about contraception. Earlier he shows that he knows the difference between contraception and abortion, so it is unlikely that the reservations he describes about inducing abortion stem from compunction about killing embryos or fetuses, at least in his own attitudes.

As long as killing infants, either directly or indirectly through abandonment, were accepted practices in human society, it was unlikely that anyone would truly reflect upon the morality of killing fetuses or embryos. If it is morally acceptable to kill infants, why would it not also be morally acceptable to kill fetuses or embryos?

In addition to prevention of moral consideration of induced abortion, infanticide and child abandonment may have been a more desirable alternative in antiquity when induced abortion of pregnancy was considered risky for the mother. For instance, Plutarch, writing in the 1st or 2nd century C.E., relates a story about the legendary Spartan lawgiver Lycurgus:

> Polydectes also died soon afterwards, and then, as was generally thought, the kingdom devolved upon Lycurgus; and until his brother’s wife was known to be with child, he was king. But as soon as he learned of this, he declared that the kingdom belonged to her offspring, if it should be male, and himself administered the government only as guardian. Now the guardians of fatherless kings are called "prodikoi" by the Lacedaemonians. 
>  
> Presently, however, the woman made secret overtures to him, proposing to destroy her unborn babe on condition that he would marry her when he was a king of Sparta; and although he detested her character, he did not reject her proposition, but pretended to approve and accept it. He told her, however, that she need not use drugs to produce a miscarriage, thereby injuring her health and endangering her life, for he would see to it himself that as soon as her child was born it should be put out of the way.
> 
> In this manner he managed to bring the woman to her full time, and when he learned that she was in labour, he sent attendants and watchers for her delivery, with orders, if a girl should be born, to hand it over to the women, but if a boy, to bring it to him, no matter what he was doing.

## Implications

The main thesis of this article is that those of us who have compunction about abortion as a method of fertility control must frame our strategies with the awareness that we desire a version of human civilization that has not yet existed. In the context of human history, our position is new, tenuous, and radical.

For those who have compunction about abortion,

* There is no golden era state of affairs to return to. There are just millennia of infanticide, child abandonment, and feticide. Conservative attitudes are not helping.
* Deadlock perpetuates abortion. This is particularly relevant when it comes to how to engage with politics, if at all.


For those who advocate abortion,

* You are not selling anything new. "Progressive" is self-aggrandizing foolishness.
