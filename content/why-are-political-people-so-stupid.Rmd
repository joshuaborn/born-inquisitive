## Introduction

* Partisanship
    * Groupthink bias. Less salient viewpoints are silenced.
      * A lack of exposure to a diversity of viewpoints leads to intellectual weakness.
    * Spitefulness. Hatred of the out-group becomes a motive unto itself.
    * Out-group viewpoints are routinely misrepresented.
    * Generic thinking and demagoguery
    * Narratives. Harari's idea of mythology. When walking around with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Real understanding of social issues is nuanced, detailed, and does not resolve into an easy ongoing story.
* News cycle (There has been more attention to the issue of biased news sources in the United States. But why is paying attention to the news a good thing in the first place? The news consists of anecdotes and unrepresentative samples. Thus, it makes people less informed because they think they are informed when they are not.)
    * Fallacy of celebrated cases. Kahneman's availability heuristic.
    * Anecdotes generally
    * Media selection bias
    * Browse not search. Short attention span means no detailed knowledge of a social issue.
    * Lack of historical context. 
* Debate
    * Motivated reasoning
    * Lawyer-mode versus scientist-mode
    * Selection bias again
