## Terminology

This article discusses the fallacies associated with judging an individual based on how the individual is categorized as one of a large population of individuals. The word "prejudice" can be used to name this practice. However, "prejudice" in the English can be interpreted either too broadly or too narrowly.

For instance, the first definition for "prejudice" in the _American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language_ consists of two parts: "the act or state of holding unreasonable preconceived judgments or convictions," and "an adverse judgment or opinion formed unfairly or without knowledge of the facts." [@pickett_american_2018] This first definition is more broad than how "prejudice" is used in this article; there are many different kinds of such prejudice, beyond the specific kind discussed in this article.

The second definition for "prejudice" in the _American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language_ is "irrational suspicion or hatred of a particular social group, such as a race or the adherents of a religion." [@pickett_american_2018] This is similar to how the word "bigotry" is used in contemporary discourse.

This second definition is more narrow than how "prejudice" is used in this article in at least two ways. First, this definition applies specifically to judgments about human beings, whereas the fallacies discussed here apply equally well when reasoning about rocks, single-celled organisms, music, countries, or anything else that can be categorized. Second, this definition construes "prejudice" as referring to judgments that are undesirable, whereas the way "prejudice" is used in this article can refer to judgments about desirable traits, as well.

Because the English language lacks a word with the precise scope desired by this article, the phrase "category-based prejudice" is used.


## Analytical vs. Moral Dimensions

The criticisms this article puts forth of category-based prejudice are entirely with regard to the flaws such prejudice imparts on one's understanding of the world. Much can be written about the [moral](/moral-skepticism.html) aspects of category-based prejudice targeting human beings in particular, but writing about the evils of bigotry are are beyond the scope of this article and left to works of social science or history. Instead, this article focuses on criticisms of category-based prejudice as a form of reasoning, regardless of the consequences of such thinking.

Thus, the criticisms articulated here are independent of the moral dimensions of category-based prejudice. This article puts forward the thesis that category-based prejudice is always a cognitively flawed way of thinking, even if there does not appear to be anything morally objectionable about it. Indeed, even if one judges an instance of category-based prejudice as morally justified, the fallacies in reasoning discussed in this article persist.


## Abstract Example

* _x_ position
* _y_ position
* shape
* color (continuous or discrete?)
* opacity?
* size?


## Properties of Populations vs. Individuals


### Population Mean

Example: no individual in a population has the population mean for the response variable. Use a continuous response variable.


### Population Proportions

Example: no individual in the population has proportions of colors that all shapes in the population do. 


## Arbitrariness of Categorization


### Choice of Variables for Categorization

Average response variable for one explanatory variable for a given figure is small, but the average response variable for a different explanatory variable is large. Use a continuous response variable.


### Choice of Levels of a Categorical Variable

Binning of a continuous explanatory variable into discrete categories. There needs to be at least one continuous explanatory variable for this.


## Concrete Examples: Gender Prejudice in Hiring

In order to illustrate the main flaws with category-based prejudice, this article turns from the abstract to more concrete examples. Suppose that a hiring manager at a company is considering what to look for in the next employee to be hired, and an employee suggests the next hire should be a woman because the team needs more empathy and women are more empathic. Alternatively, the manager talks to a different employee and is told to hire a man because the team needs more math ability and men are good at math.

How could such propositions as "men are good at math" or "women are more empathic" be known? 
Math is a broad subject, and the skill sets for doing arithmetic quickly by hand, for doing university physics problems with calculus, or for proving mathematical theorems are quite different. It behooves the employee desiring more math skills to identify exactly what kind of math skills are needed. In so doing, the appropriate test for these math skills might be identified. 

With regard to traits such as empathy, psychologists often spend large amounts of time and effort attempting to devise a test that is reliable, i.e., self-consistent and consistent across various contexts, and valid, i.e., actually measuring what it is supposed to measure. There are various schools of thought and approaches to development of such tests, but overall the goals of these approaches are similar: to devise a method for measuring a psychological property.

What both of these propositions presuppose, then, is that there is some _instrument of measurement_ by which the relevant math skills or empathy traits can be discerned. Otherwise, the propositions are uninformative, empty speech.

Additionally, in order to generalize results to "men" or "women," a more precise _target population_ needs to be identified. This might be all the men or women in a certain place and time frame, or perhaps all job applicants to a company. Once the target population is identified, a _sampling frame_ must be devised that can be used to identify each individual in the target population and that allows the target population to be sampled. Once that is accomplished, a _representative sample_ can be selected from the target population, the instrument of measurement can be applied to each individual in the sample, and statistical analysis can done to infer estimates of the relevant values in the target population. Then, the hiring manager would know the relative math abilities or empathy levels of men and women in the population of interest.

However, properties of populations are not properties of individuals, so the hiring manager still needs to apply this general knowledge to the specific job applicant that the hiring manager is evaluating. This raises the question: _why not just apply the instrument of measurement to the job applicant directly?_

Therein lies the first flaw of category-based prejudice. Invoking knowledge about population attributes in judging individuals adds a layer of indirection to the evaluation of the individual. This indirection adds additional costs to a judgment: the cost of sampling, the cost of administering the instrument of measurement to every individual in a sample large enough for statistical inference, and the cost of doing the statistical analysis. Furthermore, this indirection actually leads to a weaker conclusion.

The conclusion is weaker for at least two reasons: there is more error involved in the calculation of estimates of the measure of the population than in the measure of the individual, and the information from the prejudicial approach is probabilistic when applied to the individual.

There is no instrument of measurement that is perfect, and there is intrinsic _measurement error_ that comes whenever using an instrument of measurement. This error is present whether measuring the job applicant directly or measuring the individuals in a sample to make an inference about the population.[^nonsampling] However, in inferring a generalized conclusion about the population, sampling error is introduced in addition to measurement error.[^census] This sampling error comes from the element of randomness introduced from selecting a representative sample from the population.

[^nonsampling]: Statistical results are usually reported with some indication of the error that comes with them, such as confidence intervals, margins of error, or _p_-values. However, this typically reflects just sampling error and not forms of nonsampling error such as measurement error.

[^census]: This is provided that the population is not small enough that taking a census of the entire population is practical.

* However, it's rare for the sampled population in a study to include the population of interest, e.g., all job seekers in certain country.
* The conclusion that one can draw about the individual of interest is still weaker than just measuring the individual directly, since the conclusion is just probabilistic.
* Furthermore, the probabilistic information is usually not valid for a particular individual of interest because the individual is not randomly selected from the population.
* The information about the individual of interest can be ambiguous, e.g., stereotypes about math ability based on "Asian" versus "woman" categories.
