## Terminology

This article discusses the fallacies associated with judging an individual based on how the individual is categorized as one of a large population of individuals. The word "prejudice" can be used to name this practice. However, "prejudice" in the English can be interpreted either too broadly or too narrowly.

For instance, the first definition for "prejudice" in the _American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language_ consists of two parts: "the act or state of holding unreasonable preconceived judgments or convictions," and "an adverse judgment or opinion formed unfairly or without knowledge of the facts." [@pickett_american_2018] This first definition is more broad than how "prejudice" is used in this article; there are many different kinds of such prejudice, beyond the specific kind discussed in this article.

The second definition for "prejudice" in the _American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language_ is "irrational suspicion or hatred of a particular social group, such as a race or the adherents of a religion." [@pickett_american_2018] This is similar to how the word "bigotry" is used in contemporary discourse.

This second definition is more narrow than how "prejudice" is used in this article in at least two ways. First, this definition applies specifically to judgments about human beings, whereas the fallacies discussed here apply equally well when reasoning about rocks, single-celled organisms, music, countries, or anything else that can be categorized. Second, this definition construes "prejudice" as referring to judgments that are undesirable, whereas the way "prejudice" is used in this article can refer to judgments about desirable traits, as well.

Because the English language lacks a word with the precise scope desired by this article, the phrase "category-based prejudice" is used.


## Analytical vs. Moral Dimensions

The criticisms this article puts forth of category-based prejudice are entirely with regard to the flaws such prejudice imparts on one's understanding of the world. Much can be written about the [moral](/moral-skepticism.html) aspects of category-based prejudice targeting human beings in particular, but writing about the evils of bigotry are are beyond the scope of this article and left to works of social science or history. Instead, this article focuses on criticisms of category-based prejudice as a form of reasoning, regardless of the consequences of such thinking.

Thus, the criticisms articulated here are independent of the moral dimensions of category-based prejudice. This article puts forward the thesis that category-based prejudice is always a cognitively flawed way of thinking, even if there does not appear to be anything morally objectionable about it. Indeed, even if one judges an instance of category-based prejudice as morally justified, the fallacies in reasoning discussed in this article remain.


## Abstract Example

* _x_ position
* _y_ position
* shape
* color (continuous or discrete?)
* opacity?
* size?


## Properties of Populations vs. Individuals


### Population Mean

Example: no individual in a population has the population mean for the response variable. Use a continuous response variable.


### Population Proportions

Example: no individual in the population has proportions of colors that all shapes in the population do. 


## Arbitrariness of Categorization


### Choice of Variables for Categorization

Average response variable for one explanatory variable for a given figure is small, but the average response variable for a different explanatory variable is large. Use a continuous response variable.


### Choice of Levels of a Categorical Variable

Binning of a continuous explanatory variable into discrete categories. There needs to be at least one continuous explanatory variable for this.


## Concrete Examples: Gender Prejudice in Hiring

* Hiring men for math ability
* Hiring women for empathy
* Continuous variable to illustrate arbitrariness of levels choice? Income level?


## Issues with Generalization

* It costs more to take a representative sample from a population and measure each individual in that sample than it does to measure the individual of interest directly. This might not be an issue if a conclusion about the population has already been done.
* However, it's rare for the sampled population in a study to include the population of interest, e.g., all job seekers in certain country.


## Issues with Application to Individual

* The conclusion that one can draw about the individual of interest is still weaker than just measuring the individual directly, since the conclusion is just probabilistic.
* Furthermore, the probabilistic information is usually not valid for a particular individual of interest because the individual is not randomly selected from the population.
* The information about the individual of interest can be ambiguous, e.g., stereotypes about math ability based on "Asian" versus "woman" categories.
