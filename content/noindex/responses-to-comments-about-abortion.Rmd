## Introduction

Writing about the morally contentious topic of induced abortion of pregnancy, I encounter a lot of comments that are, to put it politely, uninformative. Indeed, if you are a thoughtfully nuanced, critically thinking human being going about your day-to-day life, you are apt to encounter a lot of these comments and notice that the standards of discourse around abortion are quite poor. Rather than respond to the same sorts of comments over and over again, this page is intended to be a summary of all of my responses to all of these comments.

## Reasons for Poor Standards of Discourse

Before getting into the specific responses, I would like to provide a rough outline of why I believe standards of discourse about abortion are so poor:

1. Many if not most people are very poor at articulating their own feelings and therefore lack self-awareness about their own value judgments. A pure moral disagreement _per se_ occurs when two or more people have the same understanding of the facts of the matter, but have different value judgments. Therefore, those with poor self-awareness about their own value judgments are poor at understanding and discussing moral conflicts. This is not unique to abortion, but is true for all kinds of moral disagreement.
1. Moral psychology is an area rife for motivated reasoning. As such, there is much _post hoc_ rationalization invented to ornament moral value judgments. However, since these _post hoc_ rationalizations are invented after the fact, they are not the real reasons why any given person acquired a value judgment. They therefore are quite literally self-delusional stories that people tell themselves, with no informational content. Again, this is not unique to abortion, but is true for moral thinking on many different topics.
1. Because there are several factions who have established orthodoxies on abortion, and there are many people whose viewpoints are informed by conformity to a faction, oftentimes discourse about abortion is used as an opportunity to proclaim slogans and rhetoric designed to express affiliation with a political or religious group, instead of being genuine discourse. This is true for any factional issue, not just abortion.

While many issues similarly have aspects of moral disagreement, and many issues similarly have factional aspects, abortion may be the issue with the greatest intersection of these phenomena and hence the greatest poverty in standards of discourse.

The phenomenon of _post hoc_ rationalization in moral psychology has been popularly discussed by Jonathan Haidt and colleagues, and I have previously written about how [slogans and political rhetoric are bad for critical thinking](/political-rhetoric-as-shibboleths.html), so I won't go into either \#2 or \#3 from the list above any further here.

I would like to discuss reason \#1 from the list above in more detail, however, because I think it is a useful way to frame my responses. I have written at length on the philosophy of [thinking about facts versus value judgments](/moral-skepticism.html). I fear this may, frankly, go over a lot of people's heads. Instead, here I would like to discuss the _experience_ of moral value judgments, because it might be more relatable.
