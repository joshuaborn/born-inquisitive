A generic generalization is an unquantified belief about a population of numerous individuals. Such beliefs are too imprecise to constitute knowledge. However, unlike other fallacies which might lead to patently false beliefs, a generic generalization can be too imprecise to be easily demonstrated to be false. Thus, generic generalizations constitute a particularly pernicious kind of fallacy.
