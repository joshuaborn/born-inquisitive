## Introduction

"[How to Scrutinize a Statistic](/how-to-scrutinize-a-statistic.html)" discussed both the need to evaluate [practical significance](/how-to-scrutinize-a-statistic.html#practical-significance) and how this is typically done by quantifying an [effect size](/how-to-scrutinize-a-statistic.html#effect-size). The absence of summarizing an effect size was described as a fallacy of "[generic comparisons](http://localhost:4321/how-to-scrutinize-a-statistic.html#generic-comparisons)."

The phrase "generic comparison" is actually a neologism invented by this blog, but the word "generic" was used deliberately to allude to a genre of fallacy that has been studied academically and in which much of the dreadfully bad reasoning about the world dwells.


## "Generic Thinking" Defined

What unites the many [fallacies](/tags/fallacies.html) in reporting, interpreting, or analyzing empirical evidence that this blog discusses is these fallacies would appeal to a mind afflicted with what might be termed "generic thinking."

Generic thinking encompasses beliefs about an inherently quantitative subject, but that are held without any quantification. This most often occurs when someone is thinking about a large population of individuals, but not bothering to quantify these thoughts. For instance, social issues are, by their very nature, about large populations of individual human beings. Thus, whenever social criticism does not include quantification, it is generic thinking.

Generic thinking can be divided into two major kinds: generic generalization and generic comparison.


## Generic Generalization

Generic generalization is a kind of generic thinking about which there is a body of scholarship, both in academic philosophy and in psychology. A generic generalization is the predication without quantification of a property onto a subject that denotes a population of individuals.

"All swans are white," "some swans are white," "no swans are white," "approximately 74.2% of swans are white" are all beliefs about a subject &ndash; denoted by "swans" &ndash; that includes a large number of individuals. However, all of these statements include some kind of quantification, namely "all," "some," "no," or "approximately 74.2%." However, the statement "swans are white" is a generic generalization because it is unquantified.

Generic generalizations have been studied by philosophers because they can seem like a logic puzzle. For instance, statements like "dogs have four legs," "ducks lay eggs," "mosquitoes carry the West Nile virus" seem like they have the spirit of truth to them.[^examples]  However, they are all false for a portion of the population they discuss.

[^examples]: "Dogs have four legs" and "ducks lay eggs" are inspired by examples used in "Generic Generalizations" in the _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy_ [@leslie_generic_2016] and the West Nile virus example is used in "The Original Sin of Cognition" [@leslie_original_2017].

While most dogs have four legs, there are some dogs happily scampering around on three legs. Only female ducks who have reached sexual maturity even have the ability to lay eggs, so "ducks lay eggs" is only true for less than half the population it describes. A mercifully very small proportion of mosquitoes actually carry the West Nile virus.

### Resistance to Falsification

Much of the philosophizing around generic generalizations have been attempts to find some definition of truth conditions or some way of interpreting generic generalizations that would allow the ones that seem plausible to be true and the ones that are patently false to be false. [@leslie_generic_2016] This highlights precisely the main issue with generic generalizations: they seem to defy truth conditions.

In particular, generic generalizations are resistant to falsification.  Quantified beliefs have conditions under which the holder of the belief can learn that the belief is false, if it is indeed false. If someone who asserts "all swans are white" encounters a black swan, then the individual knows the belief is false. Similarly, presenting just one white swan to someone who asserts "all swans are black" demonstrates to this person that the belief is false.

The situation is reversed for the assertion "some swans are white." It is easy to show that is true, but difficult to prove false. Observation of one white swan confirms that the belief is true, but to demonstrate the belief is false without uncertainty requires observations of all the swans in the world. However, this is just a practical matter. In principle, it is known how to demonstrate the belief is false, even if the doing of it would require more work than most are willing to commit.

Statements such as "approximately 72.4\% of swans are right" can be demonstrated false, given a specified _&alpha;_ [hypothesis test level](/how-to-scrutinize-a-statistic.html#fallacies). This is slightly more complicated by the fact that for a continuous variable any such hypothesis can be arbitrarily rejected given a large enough sample size and enough statistical power, so sample size and statistical power would also have to be specified. Once these are all specified, such hypotheses can be evaluated as to their truth or falsity according to standard statistical methods.

Thus, quantified beliefs that are false can readily be demonstrated as false. The same is not the case for generic generalizations. If someone asserts "dogs lay eggs," how many viviparous dogs must be observed before this belief is demonstrated false? Similarly, how many two-legged ducks must be brought to someone who asserts "ducks have four legs" before the holder of the belief must relent?

Such resistance to falsification is a nontrivial matter because many bigoted attitudes are construed in terms of generic generalization. For instance, philosopher Sarah-Jane Leslie uses "Muslims are terrorists" and "Blacks are rapists" as examples of negative stereotypes formulated as generic generalizations. [@leslie_original_2017]

To those concerned about bigotry, this resistance to falsification is a troubling property of generic generalizations because it means that once a negative stereotype has been formulated as a generic generalization in someone's mind, it is that much more difficult to convince the holder of the negative stereotype to change the belief.


### Psychological Research

The fallacy of generic generalization is not just a philosophical concern, thanks in large part to the work of developmental psychologist Susan Gelman who discovered that people become sensitive to generic generalizations at a young age. [@gelman_childrens_2002] Psychological research in this area has gone on to find that there is a fallacious use of generic generalizations in which they are accepted at low levels of prevalence, but interpreted as if they implied high levels of prevalence. [@cimpian_generic_2010] This occurs when generic generalizations are evaluated for truth or falsity closer to "some" quantification, but interpreted as if they were closer to "all" quantification.

Generic generalizations in turn are associated with other rich areas of psychological research, specifically essentialism and the perception of abstract entities or kinds. [@brandone_lions_2012] Thus, generic generalizations are, either directly or indirectly, an active area of research in psychology.


### Implied Quantification

The examples of generic generalizations in this article have all been what are called "bald plurals," in which the subject of a sentence is a plural noun that is not proceeded by any modifier word. However, not all uses of bald plurals are truly generic generalizations.

This is due to the messy nature of natural languages. In particular, human beings are prone to make their communication more concise by abridging content. Sometimes a few sounds are left out as in the case of linguistic elision, but whole words, phrases, and clauses can be left unspoken or unwritten to be inferred from context.

Most commonly, a bald plural is used when "all" quantification is implied. For instance, in this very article, it is written that "generic generalizations are resistant to falsification." From context, it should be gleaned that _all_ generic generalizations are resistant to falsification, since this article is defining and discussing generic generalizations. However, if one went about one's day putting "all" in front of each and every universally quantified statement, it would sound strange to native English speakers. In many contexts such as this one, using the word "all" would have an emphatic connotation.

Furthermore, abridging of language likely explains the bald plurals that seem to have the spirit of truth in them. When someone says "ducks lay eggs," there is typically social context surrounding this from which can be inferred a more complicated thought such as "the system of reproduction used by species denoted by the word 'ducks' is oviparous." Social context usually gets across this more complicated idea, but with less words.

For instance, a child might ask if a duck found in a pond will give birth to little chicks that can swim about, to which an adult might reply, "no, ducks lay eggs." Given context, the longer statement about reproduction is implied, but for the sake of brevity for children who may have short attention spans, this is shortened to "ducks lay eggs."

Unlike the philosophical program of attempting to devise semantics that rescue the seemingly "true" generic generalizations while evaluating others as false,
