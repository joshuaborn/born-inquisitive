## Truth of Descriptive Beliefs

The words "true" and "false" are just symbols, and symbols can be used in a variety of ways. The definition of "truth" used here is different than that used by those who are apt to say "speak your truth" to denote things that are subjectively important to someone. The definition of truth used here is a straightforward, literal, and somewhat objective notion of truth.

A mind might have a belief. This is a representation of how the mind perceives the world external to the mind. When a belief accurately models the external world, it is a _true_ belief. When a belief in a mind and the world external to the mind are not in agreement, this is a _false_ belief.[^correspondence]

[^correspondence]: This is a correspondence definition of truth. There are also coherence definitions of truth, which in philosophical jargon are called _"a priori,"_ "analytic," "necessary," or "relations of ideas." This kind of truth comprises things that are true by definition, such as "1 + 1 = 2" or "bachelors are are unmarried men." These kinds of true beliefs are _tautologies_, i.e., they refer to the same thing twice. These kind of tautologies are only more interesting than more obvious tautologies like "2 = 2" or "bachelors are bachelors" in as much as they refer to the same thing with different symbols. This inquiry regards tautologies as not useful for understanding morality because they merely beg the question. For instance, if one were to be questioned as why one felt that stealing is wrong, and one replied "because I have defined 'wrong' that way," this would not add to anyone's understanding.

Beliefs are, in practice, rarely true or false in isolation. In order to examine truth or falsity, many interrelated beliefs are examined at once. For instance, if someone believes that a certain sack is approximately 20 kilograms in weight, in order to examine that belief, other beliefs that comprise expectations about what weight is, how heavier objects behave relative to lighter objects, and how to measure weight must also be held in order to examine whether the belief about the sack is true or false.

Because of this, instead of truth or falsity being discussed as properties of individual beliefs, this inquiry examines truth and falsity as properties of a _mental model_. A mental model includes a particular belief and all the other related beliefs necessary in order to test this belief. These kind of mental models are _descriptive,_ in that they attempt to model how things actually are.

## Belief Revision

A common definition of knowledge is justified, true belief. Thus, if a mental model is true, and if the mind that has the mental model is justified in having the mental model, then the mind _knows_ something about the external world.

No mind ever has complete and perfect knowledge of the external world. Therefore, it is prudent for a sound mind to allow for revision of its mental models. True-or-false mental models try to explain and predict phenomena in the external world. However, the explanations and predictions of _false_ mental models are flawed. Therefore, a sound mind will always try to amend false mental models in order to make them true.

The totality of the external world cannot, in practice, be observed by any given mind. Some specific circumstances of the external world can, however, be partially observed. These observations constitute _empirical evidence._

When a mind encounters evidence that is consistent with the predictions of a mental model, then it is prudent to for the mental model to persist. _When a mind encounters evidence that contradicts its mental model, then it is prudent for the mental model to be amended,_ in order to better agree with the external world. Thus, empirical evidence prompts the revision of false beliefs to better approximate true beliefs.

## Moral Sentiments

Morality can also be construed as a kind of mental model. However, moral sentiments do something other than simply try to represent the external world. Mere modeling of _how things are_ does not constitute morality. For instance, merely believing that there is stealing in the world as a matter of fact does not constitute a moral sentiment. Morality models _how things should be._

![

](/images/image.svg)

Moral sentiments occur when there is a _judgment_ or _prescription_ about the external world. Moral mental models do not merely believe that there is stealing in the world, but judge stealing to be wrong. Moral mental models are _normative,_ rather than descriptive. They do not have implications that explain or predict phenomena, but instead have implications that prescribe certain behavior (e.g., "be kind to one another") and proscribe other behavior (e.g., "do not steal").

More specifically, moral sentiments judge or prescribe the behavior of certain individuals in the external world. Few human beings morally judge the behavior of rocks or the behavior of plants.[^animals] Human beings tend to judge the behavior of other human beings and of themselves. The individuals whose behavior are judged in this way, by any specific mind, are its _moral agents._

[^animals]: Some human beings judge the behavior of non-human animals, such as in medieval animal trials in Europe or the in the context of a household pet, so this is more of a gray area.

## World Revision

While both true-or-false beliefs and moral sentiments constitute kinds of mental models, an important difference occurs in how these mental models react to contradiction with observations of the external world. Earlier it was seen that when a true-or-false mental model and the external world are in disagreement, it is prudent to amend the mental model to fit the external world. However, with moral sentiments, _when the moral mental model and the external world are in disagreement, the mind tries to amend the external world, not the mental model._

![

](/images/image.svg)

It is against the spirit of morality to have the moral sentiment that stealing is wrong, observe an incident of stealing, and then conclude, "I guess I was mistaken. Stealing is righteous." Rather, someone who has the moral sentiment that stealing is wrong and who observes an incident of stealing is expected to censure the act, try to prevent the thief from leaving with the stolen item, call the authorities, report the act, or, with a longer view, investigate the root causes of theft in society and attempt to remedy them. In other words, the purpose of a moral mental model is to amend the external world or, at the very least, the actions of moral agents.

Thus, true-or-false mental models and moral mental models are diametrically opposed in how they handle observations of the external world that contradict the mental model. These contradictions lead to a change of the mental model in the descriptive case, but lead to attempts to change the external world in the normative case.


## No Moral Truth or Moral Knowledge

For a worldview that accepts these definitions of truth, belief, and moral sentiment, it must be concluded that inquiring as to the truth of moral sentiments _is a mistake_, in the same way it is a mistake even to ask about the color of a taste or the odor of a touch. One is simply asking the wrong kind of question in these cases.

There are no conditions under which a moral sentiment is false, because any disagreement between the external world and the moral mental model is judged to be a fault of the external world, not the mental model. Indeed, this is the very point of moral judgment.

Where there is not even an opportunity for falsity, there is neither the possibility of truth. Thus, there are no moral truths. A direct consequence of this and the earlier definition of knowledge is that there is no such thing as moral knowledge. Moral knowledge is impossible, not due to any limitation of the human condition, but because the very concept of moral knowledge is nonsensical.


## Linguistic Mixing

Since descriptive beliefs and moral sentiments are different and are even in a certain sense opposite, and because descriptive beliefs and moral sentiments are evaluated in different ways, clear thinking distinguishes between the two. Unfortunately, human beings speak, hear, write, and read natural languages, and natural languages obfuscate attempts to achieve such clarity by often mixing the expression of the two. 

Two individuals can relate the same facts, but one individual might label a faction "terrorists," while the other individual might use the phrase "freedom fighters." Indeed, the two individuals might have the exact same descriptive beliefs about what has actually happened in both cases. However, the _connotation_ of the language used differs between the two individuals. The connotation of the first includes a disapproving moral sentiment, while the connotation of the second includes an approving moral sentiment.

Such connotations lead to a mixing of descriptive beliefs and moral sentiments at the level of language. Because of this, and because human beings encounter a lot of language usage in their daily lives, often the first encounter one has with a new descriptive belief also includes moral sentiments mixed with it, and the first encounter one has with a new moral sentiment also includes descriptive beliefs, be they true or false, mixed with it.

Thus, descriptive beliefs and moral sentiments do not come partitioned in a neat package, properly separated and labeled. Instead a sound mind must consciously and deliberately do such partitioning itself in order to maintain clarity in its thinking.


## The Method of Attitudinal Propositions

Doing such a mental partitioning can be facilitated by the realization that moral sentiments can readily be translated into descriptive beliefs _about the moral mental models themselves._ Such a belief can be termed an "attitudinal proposition" because it is a belief about a mind's attitude toward something.

For instance, if an individual named Zhaohui says, "stealing is wrong," then the corresponding attitudinal proposition is

> Zhaohui disapproves of stealing.

or

> Zhaohui is morally opposed to stealing.

or

> Zhaohui feels that stealing is wrong.

While it makes no sense, for the reasons described above, to attempt to evaluate the truth or falsity of the moral sentiment "stealing is wrong" itself, descriptive mental models _can_ be correct or incorrect _about_ Zhaohui's moral mental model. From the perspective of the more than seven billion human minds on the Earth, Zhaohui's mind is part of their external world.

Such attitudinal propositions make a different kind of claim than the objective statement that "stealing is wrong." They make claims about subjective mental states, claims that are true or false.

Thus, while there are no moral truths and no moral knowledge, there can be truths and knowledge about moral sentiments. 

One can quietly make this sort of translation from moral sentiments to attitudinal propositions in one's own mind. Furthermore, doing so as a matter of habit rescues a truth from a sort of dialogue that consists of untruths. These habitual translations thus create an opportunity to gain new knowledge and make a learning experience out of what, taken at face value, would not be an opportunity to learn.
