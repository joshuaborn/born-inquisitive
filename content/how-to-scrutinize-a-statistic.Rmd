## Introduction

There is a cautionary saying that warns to be wary of those who use statistics like a drunkard uses a lamppost &ndash; for support rather than for illumination.[^saying]

[^saying]: This saying was popularized in 1937, when it was commonly attributed to Scottish folklorist Andrew Lang. Andrew Lang died in 1912 and may or may not have said it, as it does not appear in any of his extant writings. Regardless of the origin of this specific version of the saying, it was likely inspired by similar figures of speech which came before it. See [this article](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/01/15/stats-drunk/) at the Quote Investigator blog for more information about the origin of the saying.

The point of this saying is to warn about those who start with a preconceived idea of a conclusion that they want to reach and then search for statistics that appear to validate that preconceived conclusion.

This is a notorious practice well known to statisticians, so much so that _How to Lie with Statistics_ [-@huff_how_1993] is still in print more than fifty years after it was originally published in 1954.

The practice is effective for at least three reasons.

First, statistics have some persuasive ability. They bring with them an atmosphere of scholarship, science, and quantitative certainty. Even when no relevant empirical observations have been made, citing statistics make it appear that a position is supported by empirical evidence.

Second, given enough time and effort, statistics can be manufactured that appear to support any arbitrary position. This can be out of intentional deception by bad actors. It can also be done accidentally by those who do not know how to do empirical inquiry well, by those afflicted by the psychology of motivated reasoning, or by researchers who out of desperation to further their academic careers in a "publish or perish" world, publish whatever they can.

Third, interpreting and scrutinizing statistics requires knowledge and skills that many laypeople do not possess. Indeed, those who have had education in statistics are sometimes prone to mistakes in using and interpreting statistical methods. Thus, misuses of statistics can go unnoticed, by the general public or by academic peer review. Indeed, as shall be seen, some misuses of statistics can actually become entrenched in academic practice.

This situation might seem so discouraging that one might be inclined to throw out the use of statistics altogether. However, this would be a rash mistake. Those who care about any social issues, medical issues, environmental issues, etc, are necessarily concerned about understanding phenomena that occur in large populations of individuals. Therefore, if one cares about such issues, one is necessarily engaged in a statistical inquiry, whether one realizes this or not.

The solution for those who care about such issues, therefore, is to be competent at scrutinizing statistics. The alternative is to be preyed upon by charlatans or, perhaps worse, to become a charlatan oneself.

Another way to conceive of this is that _statistics should be questioned,_ always, by every person who encounters them and who must make a decision on whether or not to believe what is being reported.


### Purpose of This Article

The intent of this article is to assist the reader in the enterprise of questioning the statistics you encounter. It does not assume the reader has had any formal instruction in statistics, though such instruction would be valuable in understanding the concepts used throughout.

This article is not a replacement for courses in statistics. However, the converse is also true. Statistics courses are rarely taught from the standpoint of what questions are relevant to ask when encountering a statistic. Rather, introductory statistics courses usually focus on giving students a bag of statistical tools to use in their research activities.[^courses]

[^courses]: Statistics courses beyond the introductory level usually have another kind of content. Typically, introductory courses are labeled "applied statistics" and are concerned with how to use various statistical methods. Upper-level courses are usually termed "mathematical statistics" and are concerned with the mathematical foundations of results used in statistics and how the statistical techniques are thus derived.

There is merit to knowledge of this bag of tools even if you do not do empirical research in your own life. For instance, when the toxicity of something is reported, it will often be reported by the the median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) statistic. The LD<sub>50</sub> in turn is usually derived by way of logistic regression, which is one of the tools in the bag of tools typically covered in a two semester introductory statistics sequence at the university level. Therefore, if you want to understand where this statistic comes from, you need to understand logistic regression.

This article, however, instead of discussing any one specific statistical technique, discusses questions that should be asked of all statistics regardless of how they are derived. Thus, the content of this article is both different from and complementary to the content of statistics courses.


## Provenance

The first question to ask of any statistic is in regard to its _provenance._ The word "provenance" is borrowed from historians of art who use it to refer to the practice of tracing the chronology of place and custody of a work of art back to its origin, though the word is now used by a variety of fields.

In the context of scrutinizing a statistic, determining its provenance consists of asking questions such as _"Where does this statistic come from?" "Who made the observations from which this statistic was derived?"_ and _"How were those observations made?"_

The reason this is the first question to ask of any statistic is that its answer is a prerequisite for subsequent questions to ask when scrutinizing a statistic. If you do not know where a statistic came from or how it was derived, you cannot scrutinize further.

One good thing about establishing the provenance of a statistic versus other kinds of provenance is that many if not most statistics of any quality are reported in a scholarly paper of some kind. Thus, the work of establishing provenance of a statistic usually ends with a very definitive result: a document that has a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), that you can easily record in reference management software such as Zotero or Mendeley, and that you can output into a variety of standardized formats.

This first question is phrased as "establishing provenance" and not simply "looking it up" because there are many situations where the mere act of determining where a statistic comes from is itself a fair amount of work.


### No Source Is Referenced

The most obvious situation that makes establishing provenance challenging is when a statistic is stated, but no source is referenced.

This can occur in a variety of settings, such as when reading an article or when engaging in face-to-face conversation. If the medium allows for two-way communication, it might be prudent to ask the person stating the statistic where that person encountered the statistic.

If no source is provided, that immediately casts doubt on the standards of the person stating the statistic. Such a person has not done the due diligence of scrutinizing a statistic, but is still passing it along, which is a practice that can spread misinformation.

However, while the lack of a source casts doubt on the veracity of the person asserting a statistic, it does not provide insight on the veracity of the statistic itself. In these cases, the best you can do is withhold any judgment, either assenting or denying, and try to find the origin of the statistic yourself.

Today, with the plethora of Internet search tools available, the task of finding an origin is not impossible. It is simply a value judgment you must make as to whether you want to spend your time in this manner. It is certainly within the realm of reason to stay in a state of suspended judgment about the alleged statistic and refrain from interacting with the person asserting it any further.


### Chain of References


### Primary versus Secondary Sources

Encyclopedias such as Wikipedia might be helpful tools for establishing provenance, but with one major caveat. Establishing the provenance of a statistic as discussed here is tracing the statistic back to its _origin,_ which is a _primary source._  Wikipedia has a different mission than establishing provenance, and prefers _secondary sources._

> Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources and, to a lesser extent, on tertiary sources and primary sources. . . . A secondary source provides an author's own thinking based on primary sources, generally at least one step removed from an event. It contains an author's _analysis, evaluation, interpretation, or synthesis_ of the facts, evidence, concepts, and ideas taken from primary sources. [@noauthor_wikipediano_2021]

In this article's context, a secondary source does the work of scrutinizing a statistic, which is what the reader of this article is supposed to be doing. A secondary source might be useful for comparison, but is not a replacement for finding the primary source.

That being understood, Wikipedia does contain a lot of references to primary sources, as well, even though its "no original research" policy discourages their use except under limited circumstances. Furthermore, a good secondary source will reference the primary source, and so might be a useful step along the chain of custody in order to establish provenance.
